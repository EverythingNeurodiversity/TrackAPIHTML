00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
 for everyday life.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,920
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,560
 School of Medicine.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,080
 Today we are going to talk all about dopamine and what drives you to do the things that

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
 you do.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,120
 We're going to talk about motivation and desire and craving, but also how dopamine

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,320
 relates to satisfaction and our feelings of well-being.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,320
 And of course, any discussion about dopamine has to include a discussion about the potential

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,880
 for dopamine-induced addiction.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,760
 Indeed, dopamine lies at the heart of addiction to all things.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,720
 But today we are mainly going to focus on how what we do and how we do it and how we

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,800
 conceptualize those things leads to changes in this amazing molecule in our brain and

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,160
 bodies that we call dopamine.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,760
 I'm going to teach you what dopamine is and what it is not.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,120
 There are a lot of myths about the molecule dopamine.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,760
 We often hear about so-called dopamine hits.

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,360
 Today we are going to dispel many common myths about dopamine, and we are going to talk about

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,920
 how dopamine actually works.

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,960
 We're going to discuss the biology of dopamine, the psychology.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,560
 We will discuss some neural circuits, and a really exciting aspect of dopamine biology

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,960
 are so-called dopamine schedules.

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,200
 In other words, we are going to discuss how things like food, drugs, caffeine, pornography,

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
 even some plant-based compounds can change our baseline levels of dopamine.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,680
 And in doing so, they change how much dopamine we are capable of experiencing from what could

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,040
 be very satisfying events or events that make us feel not so good because of things that

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,200
 we did or took prior.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,340
 So I promise you it's going to be a vast discussion, but I will structure it for you

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,160
 and you'll come away with a deep understanding of really what drives you.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,840
 You will also come away with a lot of tools, how to leverage dopamine so that you can sustain

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,620
 energy drive and motivation for the things that are important to you over long periods

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,920
 of time.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,200
 Before we dive into the meat of today's discussion, I'd like to share with you a fascinating result

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,580
 that really underscores what dopamine is capable of in our brains and bodies and underscores

35
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,160
 the fact that just through behaviors, no drugs, nothing of that sort, just through behaviors,

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,000
 we can achieve terrifically high increases in dopamine that are very long and sustained

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,320
 in ways that serve us.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,120
 This is a result that was published in the European Journal of Physiology.

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,800
 I'll go into it in more detail later, but essentially what it involved is having human

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,000
 subjects get into water of different temperatures.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,300
 So it was warm water, moderately cool water, and cold, cold water.

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,220
 Had them stay in that water for up to an hour and they measured by way of blood draw things

43
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,140
 like cortisol, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

44
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:07,220
 What was fascinating is that cold water exposure led to very rapid increases in norepinephrine

45
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,780
 and epinephrine, which is also just called adrenaline.

46
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,920
 It also led to increases in dopamine and these increases in dopamine were very significant.

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,720
 They kicked in around 10 or 15 minutes after submersion into the cold water, and I should

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,280
 mention the head wasn't below water, it was just up to the neck.

49
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,720
 And the dopamine release continued to rise and rise and rise and eventually reached 250%

50
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,880
 above baseline.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,000
 Now what was interesting is after subjects got out of this cold water, that dopamine

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,120
 increase was sustained.

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,340
 And I know nowadays many people are interested in using cold water therapy as a way to increase

54
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,380
 metabolism and fat loss, but also to improve sense of well-being, improve cognition, improve

55
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,820
 clarity of mind.

56
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,580
 There's something really special about this very alert but calm state of mind that seems

57
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,280
 to be the one that's optimal for pretty much everything except sleep, but for all aspects

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,160
 of work and for social engagement and for sport, that highly alert but calm state of

59
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,860
 mind really is the sweet spot that I believe most of us would like to achieve.

60
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,280
 And this cold water exposure done correctly really can help people achieve that state

61
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,240
 of mind through these increases in dopamine that last a very long time.

62
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,000
 So I will later detail the specifics of that study, what it entailed in terms of how long

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,840
 the variations that different subjects experienced as well as how to limit the amount of stress

64
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,360
 hormone cortisol that's released as a consequence of the cold water.

65
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,720
 And we will also talk about compounds, supplements that people can take in order to increase

66
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,760
 their levels of dopamine should they choose.

67
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,000
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,960
 and research roles at Stanford.

69
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,960
 It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,720
 about science and science related tools to the general public.

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,760
 In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

72
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,840
 Our first sponsor is Roka.

73
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,840
 Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolute highest quality.

74
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,640
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,880
 I can tell you that the visual system has to go through a lot of work in order to maintain

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,520
 clarity of what you see when there are shadows, when you go into different types of indoor

77
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
 lighting and so on.

78
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,320
 And a lot of glasses don't work well because you put them on and then you're in bright

79
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,200
 light and you can see fine, but then you move into a shadow and then you have to take them

80
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,320
 off and they don't adjust or they don't adjust quickly enough.

81
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,720
 With Roka, their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed with the visual system biology

82
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
 in mind.

83
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
 So you always see things with perfect clarity.

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
 The glasses are also terrific because they're very lightweight and they won't slip off

85
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,640
 your face if you're exercising, if you're running or biking.

86
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,760
 In fact, they were designed for the purpose of being able to be worn while you are engaging

87
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,760
 in those sorts of activities or simply working at your desk.

88
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,080
 I happen to wear readers at night when I drive or when I work and I love their sunglasses

89
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,760
 because I can wear them anywhere.

90
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,480
 And also the aesthetics of their sunglasses and eyeglasses are terrific.

91
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,600
 Unlike a lot of other performance glasses that frankly make people look like cyborgs,

92
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
 the aesthetics on Roka's are really terrific.

93
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
 You could wear them anywhere you'd like to go.

94
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,800

 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

99
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,960
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood

100
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,720
 and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.

101
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,920
 I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done.

102
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,600
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests, you can also analyze your DNA to see what

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,440
 you ought to be doing for your immediate and long-term health.

104
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,800
 We hear a lot these days about optimization, optimizing hormones, optimizing your metabolism,

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,000
 optimizing this, optimizing that.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,440
 But unless you know the measurements of metabolic factors, hormones, and other things that are

107
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,320
 in your blood and DNA, you don't know what to optimize.

108
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,000
 With Inside Tracker, it makes all of that very easy.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,320
 They can come to your house to take the blood and DNA test, or you can go to a nearby clinic.

110
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
 They send you the information and you take those results.

111
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,040
 And unlike a lot of laboratories doing blood work out there and DNA tests, they have a simple

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,080
 platform, a dashboard that walks you through your results and helps you identify what sorts

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,360
 of nutritional or behavioral or other types of practices you might want to incorporate

114
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,600
 into your life in order to positively impact your immediate and long-term health.

115
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,040
 It's a very easy system to use and you will gain a ton of information simply by doing that

116
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,640
 test, whether or not you end up making changes to what you're doing or not.

120
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,960
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

121
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,640
 Headspace is a meditation app backed by 25 published studies and has over 600,000 five-star

122
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
 reviews.

123
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,200
 I've been meditating for a long time, but I confess sometimes I meditate and sometimes

124
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,000
 I am very inconsistent about my meditation.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,560
 Ideally I would meditate every day for 20 or 30 minutes, but what I've found over the

126
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,680
 years is that I'll start a meditation practice and then as life gets more stressful or busier,

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,120
 which is exactly when I need to meditate more, I tend to meditate less often.

128
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,880
 Switching over to Headspace as a meditation app really helped me stay consistent with

129
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,720
 my meditation practice and that's because they have a huge range of meditations to select

130
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
 from.

131
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,440
 Some are short, some are longer and in general I try and get 20 minutes of meditation in

132
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,280
 every day, but some days it's just five minutes and they have some terrific just five minute

133
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
 meditations.

134
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,720
 The science says that even a five minute meditation can be beneficial for different aspects of

135
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,200
 our brain and body.

136
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,920
 If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer and if you do that,

137

 of meditations.

142
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,800
 I'd like to announce that there's an event that some of you may find very useful.

143
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,520
 This is an event put on by Logitech that I will be speaking at.

144
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,480
 It's called Rethink Education, the Biology of Learning, Reimagining Learning through

145
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
 Neuroscience.

146
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,360
 And at this event, I will be speaking, there will be other speakers as well, and I will

147
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,080
 be talking about neuroplasticity and its applications for teaching and for learning.

148
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,760
 I will describe what I call the plasticity super protocol that incorporates all of what

149
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,040
 we know about rapid learning, efficient learning, and the best ways to teach and learn.

150
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,280
 It's geared towards educators of all kinds.

151
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,560
 It is zero cost, so please feel free to sign up.

152
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,160
 The event is September 30th, 2021 at 3pm Eastern.

153
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,400
 You can find the registration link in the caption for this episode.

154
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,240
 So let's talk about dopamine.

155
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,360
 Most people have heard of dopamine, and we hear all the time now about dopamine hits.

156
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,600
 But actually, there's no such thing as a dopamine hit.

157
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,680
 And actually, the way that your body uses dopamine is to have a baseline level of dopamine,

158
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,520
 meaning an amount of dopamine that's circulating in your brain and body all the time.

159
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,040
 And that turns out to be important for how you feel generally, whether or not you're

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,120
 in a good mood, motivated, etc.

161
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,720
 And you also can experience peaks in dopamine above baseline.

162
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,320
 This has a very specific name in the neurobiology literature, so-called tonic and phasic release.

163
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,800
 So, I'll explain what that means in a couple of minutes, but if you remember nothing else

164
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,200
 from this episode, please remember this, that when you experience something or you crave

165
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,760
 something really desirable, really exciting to you, very pleasurable, what happens afterwards

166
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,040
 is your baseline level of dopamine drops.

167
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
 Okay?

168
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,760
 So these peaks in dopamine, they influence how much dopamine will generally be circulating

169
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
 afterward.

170
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,240
 So if you think, "Oh, a big peak in dopamine after that, I'm going to feel even better

171
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,480
 because I just had this great event," not the case.

172
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,280
 What actually happens is that your baseline level of dopamine drops.

173
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,880
 And I will explain the precise mechanism for that.

174
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
 Okay?

175
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:29,560
 In the neuroscience literature, we refer to this as tonic and phasic release of dopamine.

176
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,560
 Tonic being the low-level baseline that's always there circulating, released into your

177
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,400
 brain all the time.

178
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,640
 And then phasic, these peaks that ride above that baseline.

179
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,240
 And those two things interact.

180
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,360
 And this is really important.

181
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,400
 I'm going to teach you the underlying neurobiology, but even if you have no background in biology,

182
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,720
 I promise to make it all clear.

183
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,400
 I'll explain the terms and what they mean.

184
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,480
 And I'm excited to teach you about dopamine because dopamine has everything to do with

185
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,200
 how you feel right now as you're listening to this.

186
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,760
 It has everything to do with how you will feel an hour from now.

187
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,640
 It has everything to do with your level of motivation and your level of desire and your

188
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,000
 willingness to push through effort.

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,200
 If ever you've interacted with somebody who just doesn't seem to have any drive they've

190
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,080
 given up, or if you've interacted with somebody who seems to have endless drive and energy,

191
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,160
 what you are looking at there in those two circumstances is without question, a difference

192
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,040
 in the level of dopamine circulating in their system.

193
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,160
 There will be other factors too, but the level of dopamine is the primary determinant of

194
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,880
 how motivated we are, how excited we are, how outward facing we are, and how willing

195
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,600
 we are to lean into life and pursue things.

196
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,280
 Dopamine is what we call a neuromodulator.

197
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,800
 Neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters.

198
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,040
 Neurotransmitters are involved in the dialogue between neurons, nerve cells, and neurotransmitters

199
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,400
 tend to mediate local communication.

200
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,400
 Just imagine two people talking to one another at a concert.

201
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,200
 That communication between them is analogous to the communication carried out by neurotransmitters,

202
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,000
 whereas neuromodulators influence the communication of many neurons.

203
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
 Imagine a bunch of people dancing where it's a coordinated dance involving 10 or 20 or hundreds

204
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,360
 of people.

205
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,520
 Neuromodulators are coordinating that dance.

206
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,160
 In the nervous system what this means is that dopamine release changes the probability

207
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:30,640
 that certain neural circuits will be active and that other neural circuits will be inactive.

208
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,240
 It modulates a bunch of things all at once.

209
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,240
 That's why it's so powerful at shifting not just our levels of energy, but also our mindset,

210
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,680
 also our feelings of whether or not we can or cannot accomplish something.

211
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,120
 How does dopamine work and what does it do?

212
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,120
 First of all, it is not just responsible for pleasure.

213
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,760
 It is responsible for motivation and drive primarily at the psychological level.

214
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,040
 Also for craving.

215
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,000
 Those three things are sort of the same.

216
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,280
 Motivation drive and craving.

217
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,800
 It also controls time perception and we will get deep into how dopamine can modulate time

218
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:12,260
 perception and how important it is that everybody be able to access increases in dopamine at

219
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,560
 different time scales.

220
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,400
 This turns out to be important to not end up addicted to substances, but it also turns

221
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,040
 out to be very important to sustain effort and be a happy person over long periods of

222
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,720
 time which I think most everybody wants.

223
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,320
 It certainly is adaptive in life to be able to do that.

224
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,240
 Dopamine is also vitally important for movement.

225
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,520
 I'll explain the neural circuits for dopamine and mindset and dopamine in movement in a

226
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:44,440
 moment, but in diseases like Parkinson's or Louis's body's dementia, which is similar

227
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,960
 to Parkinson's in many ways.

228
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,320
 There's a depletion or death of dopamine neurons at a particular location in the brain which

229
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,960
 leads to shaky movements, challenges in speaking, challenges in particular in initiating movement.

230
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,760
 And because dopamine is depleted elsewhere too, people with Parkinson's and Louis's body

231
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,160
 dementia also experience drops in motivation and affect, meaning mood.

232
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,040
 They tend to get depressed and so on.

233
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,840
 When those people are properly treated, they can, not always, but they can recover some

234
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:24,120
 fluidity of movement, some ability to initiate movement and almost without question, those

235
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,320
 people feel better psychologically, not just because they can move, but also because dopamine

236
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,720
 impacts mood and motivation.

237
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,520
 So what are the underlying neural circuits?

238
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,260
 For those of you that are not interested in biology and specific nomenclature, you can

239
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,640
 tune out now if you want, but it's actually pretty straightforward.

240
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,760
 You have two main neural circuits in the brain that dopamine uses in order to exert

241
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
 all its effects.

242
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,000
 The first one is a pathway that goes from this area in the, what's called the ventral

243
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,240
 tegmentum, that's a fancy, but ventral just means bottom and tegmentum actually means

244
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
 floor.

245
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,560
 So it's at the bottom of the brain and it's the ventral part of the floor.

246
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,920
 So it's really low in the back of the brain, the ventral tegmentum.

247
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,280
 And it goes from the ventral tegmentum to what's called the ventral striatum and the

248
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
 prefrontal cortex.

249
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,720
 Now that's a lot of language, but basically what we call this is the mesocortico limbic

250
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 pathway.

251
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,340
 This is the pathway by which dopamine influences motivation, drive and craving.

252
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,440
 It involves structures that some of you may have heard of before, things like nucleus

253
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,000
 accumbens and the prefrontal cortex.

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,560
 This is the pathway that really gets disrupted in addictions where in particular drugs that

255
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,160
 influence the release of dopamine like cocaine and methamphetamine, we'll talk about those

256
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,780
 drugs today, they tap into this pathway.

257
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,780
 But if you are pursuing a partner, a boyfriend or girlfriend, if you're pursuing a degree

258
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,200
 in school, if you're pursuing a finish line in a race, you are tapping into this so-called

259
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,460
 mesocortico limbic pathway.

260
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,560
 This is the classic reward pathway in all mammals.

261
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,400
 The other pathway emerges from an area in the brain called the substantia nigra, so-called

262
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,760
 because the cells in that area are dark and the substantia nigra connects to an area of

263
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,520
 the brain called the dorsal striatum.

264
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,600
 This is not surprisingly called the nigrostriatal pathway.

265
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,560
 For those of you who have never done any neuroanatomy, I'm going to teach you a little trick right

266
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,680
 now.

267
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,700
 Using a neuroanatomy, the first part of a word tells you where the neurons are and then

268
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,900
 the second part tells you where they are connecting to.

269
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,300
 So when I say nigrostriatal pathway, it means that the neurons are in the substantia nigra

270
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,660
 and they connect to the striatum, nigrostriatal pathway.

271
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,420
 So while it's a lot of language, there is some logic there.

272
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,000
 So we've got these two pathways, one mainly for movement.

273
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,020
 This is the substantia nigra to dorsal striatum and we've got this other pathway, the so-called

274
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,300
 mesocortical limbic pathway that's for reward, reinforcement and motivation.

275
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,820
 I want you to remember that there are two pathways.

276
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,640
 If you don't remember the two pathways in detail, that's fine, but please remember that there

277
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,720
 are two pathways because that turns out to be important later.

278
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,200
 Now the other thing to understand about dopamine is that the way that dopamine is released

279
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:24,800
 in the brain and body can differ, meaning it can be very local or it can be more broad.

280
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,940
 Now most of you have probably heard of synapses.

281
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,700
 Synapses are the little spaces between neurons and basically neurons, nerve cells communicate

282
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,220
 with one another by making each other electrically active or by making each other less electrically

283
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
 active.

284
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,220
 So here's how this works.

285
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,260
 You can imagine one nerve cell and another nerve cell with a little gap between them,

286
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,980
 a little synapse.

287
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,540
 And the way that one nerve cell causes the next nerve cell to fire, what we call fire

288
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,640
 really means to become electrically active is that it vomits out these little packets,

289
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
 what we call vesicles.

290
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,040
 They're little bubbles filled with a chemical.

291
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:05,080
 When that chemical enters the synapse, some of it docks or parks on the other side in

292
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:12,600
 the other neuron and by virtue of electrical changes in what we call the post-synaptic neuron,

293
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,120
 that chemical will make that neuron more electrically active or less electrically active.

294
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,580
 One can do that like any other neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.

295
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,140
 So it can have one neuron influence another neuron.

296
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,080
 But dopamine can also engage in what's called a volumetric release.

297
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,940
 Volumetric release is like a giant vomit that gets out to 50 or 100 or even thousands

298
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
 of cells.

299
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,020
 So there's local release, what we call synaptic release, and then there's volumetric release.

300
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,420
 So volumetric release is like dumping all this dopamine out into the system.

301
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,840
 So dopamine is incredible because it can change the way that our neural circuits work at a

302
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,080
 local scale and at a very broad scale.

303
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,240
 And for those of you that are only interested in tools like how do I get more dopamine, let

304
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,640
 me tell you, this part is really important because if you were to take a drug or supplement

305
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,760
 that increases your level of dopamine, you are influencing both the local release of

306
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,000
 dopamine and volumetric release.

307
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,100
 This relates back to the baseline of dopamine and the big peak above baseline.

308
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,660
 And that turns out to be important.

309
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,420
 And I'll just allude to why it's important.

310
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:30,960
 Many drugs and indeed many supplements that increase dopamine will actually make it harder

311
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,500
 for you to sustain dopamine release over long periods of time and to achieve those peaks

312
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,980
 that most of us are craving when we are in pursuit of things.

313
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
 Why?

314
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,520
 Because if you get both volumetric release, the dumping out of dopamine everywhere and

315
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,620
 you're getting local release, what it means is that the difference between the peak and

316
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,180
 baseline is likely to be smaller.

317
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,260
 And this is very important.

318
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:02,280
 How satisfying or exciting or pleasurable a given experience is doesn't just depend on

319
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,020
 the height of that peak.

320
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,200
 It depends on the height of that peak relative to the baseline.

321
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,000
 So if you increase the baseline and you increase the peak, you're not going to achieve more

322
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,780
 and more pleasure from things.

323
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:22,060
 I'll talk about how to leverage this information in a little bit, but just increasing your

324
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,260
 dopamine, yes, it will make you excited for all things.

325
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,420
 It will make you feel very motivated, but it will also make that motivation very short-lived.

326
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,860
 So there's a better way to increase your dopamine.

327
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,380
 There's a better way to optimize this peak to baseline ratio.

328
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,280
 For now, what we've talked about is two main neural circuits, one for movement and one

329
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,280
 for motivation and craving with dopamine.

330
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,760
 And we've talked about two main modes of communication between neurons with dopamine.

331
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,160
 One is this local synaptic release.

332
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,800
 One is more volumetric release.

333
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,760
 And in the back of your mind, you can relate this back to, again, this baseline versus peaks

334
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,360
 above baseline.

335
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,020
 So that's a description of what we would call the spatial effects or the spatial aspects

336
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,020
 of dopamine.

337
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,460
 I said, this connects to that, that connects to this, you can get local or more broad volumetric

338
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,460
 release.

339
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,660
 What about the duration of release or the duration of action for dopamine?

340
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:25,700
 Well, dopamine is unique among chemicals in the brain because dopamine, unlike a lot of

341
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,540
 chemicals in the brain, works through what are called G protein coupled receptors.

342
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,520
 And for those of you that are about to pass out from the amount of detail, just hang in

343
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
 there with me.

344
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,080
 It's really not complicated.

345
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,600
 There are two ways that neurons can communicate or mainly two ways.

346
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,920
 There are a third and a fourth, but mostly neurons communicate by two modes.

347
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,440
 One are what we call fast electrical synapses, ionotropic conduction.

348
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
 All right.

349
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,280
 You don't need to know what that means, but basically one neuron activates another neuron

350
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,260
 and little holes open up in that neuron and ions rush in.

351
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,960
 Sodium is the main ion salt by which one neuron influences the electrical activity of another

352
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,700
 neuron because sodium ions contain a charge.

353
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
 Okay.

354
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,500
 There are other things like chloride and potassium.

355
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,180
 If you're interested in looking this up, just look up.

356
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,740
 Ionot conductance is in the action potential or I could do a post on it sometime and we

357
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,500
 could go into detail, but just understand that when neurons want to influence each other,

358
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,640
 they can do it by way of this fast ionotropic conduction.

359
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,320
 This is a really quick way for one neuron to influence the next.

360
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,840
 Dopamine doesn't communicate that way.

361
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
 Dopamine is slower.

362
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,640
 It works through what are called G protein coupled receptors.

363
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,520
 So what happens is dopamine is released in these little vesicles that I mentioned before

364
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,320
 get vomited out into the synapse.

365
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,320
 Some of that dopamine will bind to the so-called post synaptic neuron.

366
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,480
 It will bind to the next neuron and then it sets off a cascade.

367
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,740
 It's kind of like a bucket brigade of one thing getting handed off to the next, to the

368
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,240
 next, to the next.

369
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,180
 It's G protein coupled receptors.

370
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,940
 And anytime you hear about these GPCRs or G protein coupled receptors, pay attention

371
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,820
 because they're really interesting.

372
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,240
 They're slow, but they also can have multiple cascades of effects.

373
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,420
 They can impact even gene expression at some level.

374
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,340
 They can change what a cell actually becomes.

375
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:23,200
 They can change how well or how poorly that cell will respond to the same signal in the

376
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
 future.

377
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,520
 So dopamine works through the slower process, these G protein coupled receptors.

378
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,480
 And so its effects tend to take a while in order to occur.

379
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,840
 This aspect of dopamine transmission is important because it now underscores two things.

380
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,960
 One, there's two pathways for dopamine to communicate, one for movement, one for motivation

381
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
 and craving.

382
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,660
 Two, spatial scales at which dopamine can operate synaptically or volumetrically.

383
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:58,340
 And dopamine can have slow effects, really slow effects or even very long lasting effects.

384
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,780
 And it even can control gene expression.

385
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,640
 It can actually change the way that cells behave.

386
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,900
 One thing that's not often discussed about dopamine, but is extremely important to know

387
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,500
 is that dopamine doesn't work on its own.

388
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,360
 Because that release dopamine co-release glutamate.

389
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,640
 Glutamate is a neurotransmitter and it's a neurotransmitter that is excitatory, meaning

390
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,920
 it stimulates neurons to be electrically active.

391
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,840
 So now, even if you don't know any cell biology, it should start to gain a picture that dopamine

392
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,440
 is responsible for movement, motivation and drive.

393
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,640
 It does that through two pathways, but also the dopamine stimulates action in general

394
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,000
 because it releases this excitatory neurotransmitter.

395
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,360
 It tends to make certain neurons that are nearby or even that are far away because of

396
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
 volumetric release.

397
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,200
 It tends to make those more active.

398
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,400
 So dopamine is really stimulating.

399
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,960
 And indeed, we say that dopaminergic transmission or dopamine tends to stimulate sympathetic

400
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
 arousal.

401
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,880
 Sympathetic doesn't have anything to do with sympathy.

402
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,420
 It's just simply means that it tends to increase our levels of alertness.

403
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:13,560
 It tends to bring an animal or a human into a state of more alertness, readiness and desire

404
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,520
 to pursue things outside the confines of its skin.

405
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,520
 So if I were to just put a really simple message around dopamine, it would be there's a molecule

406
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,520
 in your brain and body that when released tends to make you look outside yourself, pursue

407
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,720
 things outside yourself and to crave things outside yourself.

408
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,220
 The pleasure that arrives from achieving things also involves dopamine, but is mainly the consequence

409
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,940
 of other molecules.

410
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,460
 But if ever you felt lethargic and just lazy and you had no motivation or drive, that's

411
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,620
 a low dopamine state.

412
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,860
 If ever you felt really excited, motivated, even if you're a little scared to do something,

413
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,420
 maybe did your first skydive or you're about to do your first skydive or you're about to

414
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,020
 do some public speaking and you really don't want to screw it up.

415
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,060
 You are in a high dopamine state.

416
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:12,680
 Dopamine is a universal currency in all mammals, but especially in humans for moving us toward

417
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:19,640
 goals and how much dopamine is in our system at any one time compared to how much dopamine

418
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,820
 was in our system a few minutes ago and how much we remember enjoying a particular experience

419
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:33,400
 of the past that dictates your so-called quality of life and your desire to pursue things.

420
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
 This is really important.

421
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,760
 Dopamine is a currency and it's the way that you track pleasure.

422
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,500
 It's the way that you track success.

423
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,140
 It's the way that you track whether or not you are doing well or doing poorly.

424
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,360
 And that is subjective.

425
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,100
 But if your dopamine is too low, you will not feel motivated.

426
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,500
 If your dopamine is really high, you will feel motivated.

427
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,780
 And if your dopamine is somewhere in the middle, how you feel depends on whether or not you

428
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:04,420
 had higher dopamine a few minutes ago or lower dopamine.

429
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,960
 This is important.

430
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:13,120
 Your experience of life and your level of motivation and drive depends on how much dopamine you

431
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,240
 have relative to your recent experience.

432
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,200
 This is again something that's just not accounted for in the simple language of dopamine hits.

433
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
 Okay?

434
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,680
 A simple way to envision dopamine hits is every time you do something you like eat a piece

435
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,040
 of chocolate, dopamine hit.

436
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,720
 You look at your Instagram, dopamine hit.

437
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,000
 You see someone you like, dopamine hit.

438
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,340
 You know, all these things described as dopamine hits neglect the fact that if you scroll social

439
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,780
 media and you see something you really like, dopamine hit.

440
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,780
 Sure.

441
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,100
 There's an increase in dopamine, but then you get to something else and you go, not that

442
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
 interesting.

443
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,940
 However, had you arrived at that second thing first, you might think that it was really

444
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,940
 interesting.

445
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,660
 If you had arrived to that second Instagram post three days later or four days later,

446
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,120
 you might find it extremely interesting.

447
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,840
 Again, how much dopamine you experience from something depends on your baseline level of

448
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,880
 dopamine when you arrive there and your previous dopamine peaks.

449
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,040
 Okay?

450
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,920
 That's super important to understand.

451
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,400
 And it's completely neglected by the general language of dopamine hits.

452
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,520
 This is why when you repeatedly engage in something that you enjoy, your threshold for

453
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,160
 enjoyment goes up and up and up.

454
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,220
 I want to talk about that process and I want to explain how that process works because

455
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,940
 if you understand that process and you understand some of these schedules and kinetics as we

456
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,780
 call them around dopamine, you will be in a terrific position to use any dopamine enhancing

457
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,660
 tools that you decide to use.

458
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,020
 You'll be in an excellent position to modulate and control your own dopamine release for

459
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,980
 optimal motivation and drive.

460
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,140
 I realized that was a lot of information about the biology of dopamine.

461
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,000
 Sort of like trying to make you drink from the fire hose of dopamine biology.

462
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,840
 However, I realized that some people probably want even more information about the biology

463
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,160
 of dopamine transmission.

464
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,080
 If you're interested in that, I'll post a link to a absolutely stellar review that was

465
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,560
 published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience called Spatial Intemporal Scales of Dopamine Transmission.

466
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,200
 It is quite detailed, but they have beautiful diagrams and can walk you through all the things

467
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,720
 that I just described and get into even more detail.

468
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,380
 We'll put a link to that in the caption on YouTube.

469
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:32,860
 Right now, I want to share with you two anecdotes, one from my own life and one from some fairly

470
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:39,140
 recent history that illustrate some of the core biology of dopamine and how profoundly

471
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,580
 it can shape our experience.

472
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:47,260
 The first one is a really tragic situation that occurred.

473
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:55,120
 This was in the 80s, there was a outbreak of what looked like Parkinsonian symptoms in

474
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,720
 a young population.

475
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,680
 Many of you heard of Parkinson's disease.

476
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,160
 Parkinson's disease is a disease in which people initially start to quake, can't generate

477
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,720
 smooth movements, they'll have issues with speech, sometimes cognition as well.

478
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,600
 There are examples like Michael J. Fox, which are early onset Parkinson's.

479
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,800
 Typically, it hits people a little bit later in life.

480
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,780
 There's a genetic component, but there is this question and there's always been this

481
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:28,620
 question whether or not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's.

482
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:37,220
 Some years ago, there was a situation where laboratory, street laboratories, illicit laboratories,

483
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,860
 were trying to make a drug called MPPP, which is an opioid-like compound.

484
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:48,520
 It's a bit like heroin and heroin addicts seeking heroin went out and bought what they

485
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,160
 thought was MPPP.

486
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,400
 Unfortunately, it was not MPPP.

487
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,120
 I mean, it would have been tragic if it was anyway because they were drug addicts, but

488
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,320
 what they ended up taking turned out to be a lot worse.

489
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:10,840
 What they ended up taking was MPTP and MPTP can arise in the synthesis of MPPP.

490
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,700
 So someone in a lab someplace, this was mainly in the Central Valley in California, but elsewhere

491
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:24,780
 as well, somebody created MPTP and what ended up happening was a large number of young people

492
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:31,780
 who were opioid addicts became completely boxed in paralyzed, couldn't speak, couldn't

493
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,940
 blink, couldn't do anything, couldn't function, couldn't move.

494
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,940
 So both aspects of dopamine transmission were disrupted.

495
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,360
 They had no motivation and drive.

496
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,760
 They couldn't generate any movement of any kind.

497
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,920
 They were literally locked in frozen.

498
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,640
 And sadly, this is irreversible.

499
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:58,400
 It's irreversible because what MPTP does is it kills the dopaminergic neurons of the

500
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,160
 substantia nigra, that nigrostriatal pathway that's involved in generating movement.

501
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,980
 And it kills the dopaminergic neurons of the so-called mesocortical limbic pathway.

502
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,100
 I was in college when this whole MPTP thing happened and I remember hearing this story

503
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,420
 at the time, I had no understanding of what it is to have very high levels of dopamine

504
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,780
 or extremely depleted levels of dopamine.

505
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,580
 There was no reason why I should have that understanding.

506
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,260
 I mean, of course I had experienced different pleasures of different kinds and I've had

507
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:33,760
 lows in my life, but nothing to the extreme that I'm about to discuss.

508
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,920
 I got Giardia.

509
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,840
 And Giardia is a stomach bug that if any of you ever had it, it is terrible.

510
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,040
 It's terrible diarrhea.

511
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,020
 You end up very dehydrated very quickly.

512
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,920
 You drop a ton of weight and it is extremely unpleasant.

513
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:54,920
 I ended up going to the emergency room and in the emergency room, I begged them for something

514
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,420
 to stop up my guts and they gave it to me.

515
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,540
 They put a saline line in to rehydrate me and they injected something into the saline

516
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:13,700
 bag and within minutes, I felt more sadness, more overwhelming sense of depression, basically

517
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,660
 lower than I'd ever felt in my entire life.

518
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,620
 It was absolutely profound.

519
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,660
 I was crying endlessly without knowing why I was crying.

520
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,820
 I was miserable.

521
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,840
 And I asked them, what did you inject?

522
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,560
 And they said, we injected Thorazine.

523
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,600
 Thorazine is an antipsychotic drug.

524
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,220
 It's actually used to block dopamine receptors.

525
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,360
 It's what's given to people who have schizophrenia often is given to people who have schizophrenia

526
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,680
 because schizophrenia involves among other things, elevated levels of dopamine.

527
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,960
 It was horrible.

528
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,320
 The experience of it was miserable unlike anything I'd ever experienced.

529
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,620
 And so I actually said to them, what did you give me?

530
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,900
 They said Thorazine.

531
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,820
 And I said, you have to give me Eldopa.

532
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,180
 You have to give me something to get my dopamine levels back up again.

533
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,180
 And they did.

534
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,140
 They gave me an injection of Eldopa into the bag, went straight into my bloodstream and

535
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,300
 within minutes, I felt fine again.

536
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,100
 It was incredible and it really opened up my mind and my experience to what it is to

537
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,260
 have absolutely plummeted levels of dopamine.

538
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,620
 There's nothing more miserable than that.

539
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,620
 I'll tell you.

540
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:29,480
 And these poor souls who had this MPTP experience, unfortunately, they couldn't recover those

541
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
 cells.

542
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,440
 People who have severe Parkinson's are struggling with this as well because in Parkinson's and

543
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,960
 in Lewy body dementia, the dopaminergic neurons often die.

544
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,160
 It's not just a problem with those neurons releasing enough dopamine.

545
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,040
 Later we're going to talk about some approaches to maintaining dopaminergic neuron health

546
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,000
 and things that we can all do for that.

547
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,520
 But I will tell you, these dopamine neurons that we all have are very precious for movement

548
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,580
 and mood and motivation.

549
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:59,420
 Having experienced what it is to have very, very low levels of dopamine or in this case

550
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:06,780
 to have my dopamine receptors blocked from Thorazine was eyeopening to say the least

551
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,460
 and has given me tremendous sensitivity to the fact that dopamine is perhaps one of the

552
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,900
 most powerful molecules that any of us has inside of us and the one that we ought to

553
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:24,300
 all think very carefully about how we leverage because while most experiences and most things

554
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,900
 that we do and take and eat and et cetera won't create enormous highs and enormous lows

555
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:35,980
 in dopamine, even subtle fluctuations in dopamine really shape our perception of life and what

556
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,200
 we're capable of and how we feel.

557
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,700
 And so we want to guard those and we want to understand them.

558
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,940
 So let's lean into that understanding about dopamine and then let's talk about some tools

559
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:49,540
 that we can all use to leverage dopamine in order to keep that baseline in the appropriate

560
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,840
 healthy place and still be able to access those peaks in dopamine because those after

561
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,500
 all are some of what makes life rich and worth living.

562
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,500
 So let's talk about the baseline of dopamine that we all have and the peaks in dopamine

563
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:10,860
 that we all can achieve through different activities and things that we ingest.

564
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,980
 All of us have different baseline levels of dopamine.

565
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,260
 Some of this is sure to be genetic.

566
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,860
 Some people just simply ride at a level a little bit higher.

567
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,660
 They're a little bit more excited.

568
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:29,060
 They're a little bit more motivated or maybe they're a lot more excited or a lot more motivated.

569
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,540
 Some people are a little mellower.

570
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,660
 Some people are a little less excitable.

571
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,700
 And some of that has to do with the fact that dopamine doesn't act alone.

572
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,380
 Dramamine has close cousins or friends in the nervous system.

573
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,420
 And I'll just name off a few of those close cousins and friends.

574
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:52,120
 Epinephrine also called adrenaline is the main chemical driver of energy.

575
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,900
 We can't do anything, anything at all unless we have some level of epinephrine in our brain

576
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
 and body.

577
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,260
 It's released from the adrenal glands, which ride to top our kidneys.

578
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,660
 It's released from an area of the brainstem called locus ceruleus.

579
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:11,940
 And its release tends to wake up neural circuits in the brain and wake up various aspects of

580
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,860
 our body's physiology and give us a readiness.

581
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:21,460
 So it should come as no surprise that dopamine and epinephrine, aka adrenaline, hang out

582
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,460
 together.

583
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,340
 In fact, epinephrine and adrenaline are actually manufactured from dopamine.

584
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,260
 There's a biochemical pathway involving dopamine, which is just a beautiful pathway.

585
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,820
 If ever you want to look it up, you could just look up biochemistry of dopamine.

586
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:43,740
 But what you'll find is that L-dopa is converted into dopamine.

587
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:51,900
 Dopamine is converted into noradrenaline, norepinephrine, it's also called, and noradrenaline, norepinephrine

588
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,580
 is converted into adrenaline.

589
00:38:54,580 --> 00:39:00,860
 So not only are dopamine and epinephrine, aka adrenaline close cousins, they are actually

590
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,660
 family members.

591
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,660
 They're closely related.

592
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,260
 I'm not going to get too deep into epinephrine today.

593
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,460
 I'm not going to talk too much about those pathways.

594
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,180
 But anytime I'm talking about dopaminergic transmission or that you have a peak in dopamine,

595
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,820
 inevitably that means that you have a peak in release of epinephrine as well.

596
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:24,420
 What dopamine does is dopamine really colors the subjective experience of an activity to

597
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,220
 make it more pleasurable, to make it something that you want more of.

598
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,260
 Epinephrine is more about energy.

599
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:37,580
 Epinephrine alone can be fear, paralysis, trauma, not physical paralysis, but mental

600
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:43,100
 paralysis, frozen in fear or being traumatized or scared.

601
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,700
 But the addition of dopamine to that chemical cocktail, if dopamine was released in the

602
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,460
 brain, well then that epinephrine becomes one of excitement.

603
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:57,540
 I'm using a broad brush here, but essentially what you need to know is that dopamine and

604
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,300
 epinephrine, aka adrenaline, are family members and they tend to work together like a little

605
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,140
 gang to make you seek out certain things.

606
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:12,300
 So what sorts of activities, what sorts of things increase dopamine and how much do they

607
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,700
 increase dopamine?

608
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:21,460
 Let's take a look at some typical things that people do out there or ingest out there that

609
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,940
 are known to increase dopamine.

610
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,300
 So let's recall that you have a baseline level of dopamine and that everybody does.

611
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,500
 And even within a family, you might have family members who are very excitable, happy and

612
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,300
 motivated and others who are less excitable, happy and motivated.

613
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:42,820
 But your level of dopamine has everything to do with those genetics, but also with what

614
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:48,340
 you've experienced in the previous days and the previous months and so on.

615
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,900
 When you do or ingest certain things, your levels of dopamine will rise above baseline,

616
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,860
 transiently.

617
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:01,380
 And depending on what you do or ingest, it will rise either more or less and it will

618
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,820
 be very brief or it will last a long time.

619
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:09,060
 So let's take a look at some of the typical things that people take and do and eat.

620
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,460
 Some are good for us, some are not good for us.

621
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,260
 And let's ask how much dopamine is increased above baseline.

622
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,880
 Now, of course, these are averages, but these are averages that have been measured in so-called

623
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,900
 micro dialysis studies in animals.

624
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,060
 So actually extracting from particular brain areas how much dopamine is released or from

625
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:32,500
 measuring the serum, the circulating levels of dopamine in humans.

626
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,980
 Chocolate, they didn't look at milk versus dark chocolate, but chocolate will increase

627
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,180
 your baseline level of dopamine 1.5 times.

628
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,180
 Okay.

629
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,580
 So it's a pretty substantial increase in dopamine.

630
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:49,720
 Since transient, it goes away after a few minutes or even a few seconds.

631
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:57,040
 I'll explain what determines the duration in a minute, but 1.5 times for chocolate.

632
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:06,440
 Sex, both the pursuit of sex and the act of sex increases dopamine two times.

633
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,080
 So it's a doubling above baseline.

634
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,880
 Now of course, there's going to be variation there, but that's the average increase in

635
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,860
 baseline dopamine caused by sex.

636
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,020
 Later I will talk about how the different aspects of the so-called arousal arc, the

637
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,420
 different aspects of sex, believe it or not, have a differential impact on dopamine.

638
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:36,420
 But for now, as a general theme or activity, sex doubles the amount of dopamine circulating

639
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,620
 in your blood.

640
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:47,160
 And in particular nicotine that is smoked like cigarettes and so forth increases dopamine

641
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,000
 two and a half times above baseline.

642
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,280
 So there's a peak that goes up above baseline two and a half times higher.

643
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,240
 It is very short lived.

644
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,560
 Anyone who's ever been a chain smoker or observed a chain smoker understands that the increase

645
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,320
 in dopamine from nicotine is very short lived.

646
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,280
 Cocaine will increase the level of dopamine in the bloodstream two and a half times above

647
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,880
 baseline.

648
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:24,020
 And amphetamine, another drug that increases dopamine, will increase the amount of dopamine

649
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,400
 in the bloodstream 10 times above baseline.

650
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,820
 A tremendous increase in dopamine.

651
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,820
 Exercise.

652
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,620
 Now, exercise will have a different impact on the levels of dopamine depending on how

653
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,660
 much somebody subjectively enjoys that exercise.

654
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:46,480
 So if you're somebody who loves running, chances are it's going to increase your levels of

655
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,380
 dopamine two times above your baseline, not unlike sex.

656
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:59,700
 People who dislike exercise will achieve less dopamine increase or no increase in dopamine

657
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,120
 from exercise.

658
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,980
 And if you like other forms of exercise like yoga or weightlifting or swimming or what

659
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,800
 have you, again, it's going to vary by your subjective experience of whether or not you

660
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,460
 enjoy that activity.

661
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,820
 This is important.

662
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,560
 And it brings us back to something that we talked about earlier.

663
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,060
 Remember that mesocortico limbic pathway?

664
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,620
 Well, the cortico part is important.

665
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:27,100
 The cortico part actually has a very specific part, which is your prefrontal cortex, the

666
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:34,040
 area of your forebrain that's involved in thinking and planning and involved in assigning

667
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:40,520
 a rational explanation to something and involved in assigning a subjective experience to something.

668
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
 All right.

669
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,640
 So for instance, the pen that I'm holding right now is one of these pilot V5s.

670
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,640
 I love these pilot V5s.

671
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,640
 They don't sponsor the podcast.

672
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,640
 I just happen to like them.

673
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,040
 I like the way that they write, how they feel.

674
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,320
 If I spent enough time thinking about it or talking about it, I could probably get a dopamine

675
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
 increase just talking about this pilot V5.

676
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,380
 And that's not because I have the propensity to release dopamine easily.

677
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,140
 It's that as we start to engage with something more and more and what we say about it and

678
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:11,120
 what we encourage ourselves to think about it has a profound impact on its rewarding

679
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,400
 or non-rewarding properties.

680
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,540
 Now it's not simply the case that you can lie to yourself and you can tell yourself,

681
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,540
 "I love something."

682
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,080
 And when you don't really love it and it will increase dopamine.

683
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,500
 But what's been found over and over again is that if people journal about something

684
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,920
 or they practice some form of appreciation for something or they think of some aspect

685
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,820
 of something that they enjoy, the amount of dopamine that that behavior will evoke tends

686
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,260
 to go up.

687
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,680
 So for people that hate exercise, you can think about some aspect of exercise that you

688
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,680
 really enjoy.

689
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:51,240
 However, I will caution you against saying to yourself, "I hate exercise or I hate studying

690
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,180
 or I hate this person, but I love the reward I give myself afterward."

691
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:01,100
 Later we're going to talk about how rewards given afterward actually make the situation

692
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,100
 worse.

693
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,660
 They won't make you like exercise more or studying more.

694
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,420
 They actually will undermine the dopamine release that would otherwise occur for that

695
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,580
 activity.

696
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,620
 So certain things, chemicals have a universal effect.

697
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,200
 They make everybody's dopamine go up.

698
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,680
 So some people like chocolate.

699
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,020
 Some people don't, of course, but in general it has causes this increase in dopamine.

700
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:28,100
 But sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine, those things cause increases in dopamine in

701
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,100
 everybody that takes them.

702
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,220
 Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working through a challenge in a relationship

703
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,460
 or working through something hard of any kind.

704
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,860
 That is going to be subjective as to how much dopamine will be released.

705
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:46,300
 And we will return to that subjective component in a little bit.

706
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:53,200
 But now you have a sense of how much dopamine can be evoked by different activities and

707
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,160
 by different substances.

708
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,400
 One that you might be wondering about is caffeine.

709
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,480
 I'm certainly drinking my caffeine today and I do enjoy caffeine and limited quantities.

710
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,600
 I drink yerba mate and I drink coffee and I love it.

711
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,240
 Does it increase dopamine?

712
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,200
 Well, a little bit.

713
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,220
 Caffeine will increase dopamine to some extent, but it is pretty modest compared to the other

714
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,140
 things that I described.

715
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,580
 Chocolate sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine and so on.

716
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,960
 However, there's a really interesting paper published in 2015.

717
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,600
 This is Volcau et al.

718
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,600
 You can look it up.

719
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
 It's very easy to find.

720
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:36,540
 It showed that regular ingestion of caffeine, whether or not it's from coffee or otherwise,

721
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:41,080
 increases up regulation of certain dopamine receptors.

722
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:48,120
 So caffeine actually makes you able to experience more of dopamine's effects.

723
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,760
 Because as I mentioned before, dopamine is vomited out into the synapse or it's released

724
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,120
 volumetrically, but then it has to bind someplace and trigger those G protein coupled receptors.

725
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,480
 And caffeine increases the number, the density of those G protein coupled receptors.

726
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,880
 Now sitting back and thinking about that, you might think, oh yeah, you know, sometimes

727
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,320
 I'll notice people, at least in the old days, that it used to be a cigarette and a cup of

728
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,560
 coffee or when people drink alcohol, oftentimes they'll smoke.

729
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,860
 And it's well known that different compounds like alcohol and nicotine or caffeine and

730
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:27,680
 nicotine or certain behaviors and certain drugs can synergize to give bigger dopamine

731
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,000
 increases.

732
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,700
 And this is not terribly uncommon.

733
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,800
 There are a lot of people nowadays who, for instance, take pre-workout energy drinks.

734
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,080
 They'll drink, I won't name names, but they'll drink a canned energy drink or they'll drink

735
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,200
 a pre-workout and they'll try and get that big stimulation, that stimulant effect for

736
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,960
 the dopamine, the norepinephrine, that family of molecules that works together to make you

737
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,960
 motivated.

738
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,120
 And then they'll also exercise to try and get even more of a dopaminergic experience out

739
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,120
 of that workout.

740
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,280
 Sometimes it's also to perform better as well, of course.

741
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,480
 But as we'll talk about in a few minutes, that aspect or that approach, rather, of trying

742
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,600
 to just get your dopamine as high as you possibly can in order to get the most out of an experience,

743
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,960
 turns out to not be the best approach.

744
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:18,760
 And what you'll find as we talk about dopamine schedules is that layering together multiple

745
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:24,720
 things, substances and activities that lead to big increases in dopamine actually can

746
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,600
 create pretty severe issues with motivation and energy right after those experiences and

747
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,360
 even a couple days later.

748
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,440
 So I'm not saying that people shouldn't take the occasional pre-workout if that's your

749
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,560
 thing or drink a cup of coffee or two before working out now and again.

750
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,680
 Some people really enjoy that.

751
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,840
 I certainly do that every once in a while.

752
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:48,520
 But if you do it too often, what you'll find is that your capacity to release dopamine and

753
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,480
 your level of motivation and drive and energy overall will take a serious hit.

754
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,080
 Now I've been alluding to this dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline thing since the beginning

755
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,080
 of the episode.

756
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,120
 We talked about tonic and phasic release and so forth.

757
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:08,080
 But now let's really drill into what this means and how to leverage it for our own purposes.

758
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,120
 In order to do that, let's take a step back and ask, why would we have a dopamine system

759
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,120
 like this?

760
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,920
 Why would we have a dopamine system at all?

761
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:21,000
 Well, we have to remember what our species primary interest is.

762
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,880
 Our species, like all species, has a main interest and that's to make more of itself.

763
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,760
 It's not just about sex and reproduction.

764
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,800
 It's about foraging for resources.

765
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,800
 Resources can be food.

766
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,800
 It can be water.

767
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,920
 It can be salt.

768
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,760
 Can be shelter.

769
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,640
 Can be social connection.

770
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,480
 Dopamine is the universal currency of foraging and seeking.

771
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,560
 We call sometimes talk about motivation and craving, but what we mean in the evolutionary

772
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:54,000
 adaptive context, what we mean is foraging and seeking, seeking water, seeking food, seeking

773
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,160
 mates.

774
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,400
 Seeking things that make us feel good and avoiding things that don't make us feel good,

775
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,160
 but in particular seeking things that will provide sustenance and pleasure in the short

776
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,600
 term and will extend the species in the long term.

777
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:13,360
 Once we understand that dopamine is a driver for us to seek things, it makes perfect sense

778
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,600
 as to why it would have a baseline level and it would have peaks and that the baseline

779
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,080
 and peaks would be related in some sort of direct way.

780
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,040
 Here's what I mean by that.

781
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,400
 Let's say that you were not alive now, but you were alive 10,000 years ago and you woke

782
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:36,360
 up and you looked and you realized you had minimal water and you had minimal food left.

783
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,120
 Maybe you have a child, maybe you have a partner, maybe you're in an entire village, but you

784
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:45,280
 realize that you need things.

785
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,320
 You need to be able to generate the energy to go seek those things.

786
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,120
 And chances are there were dangers in seeking those things.

787
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:57,000
 Yes, it could be saber tooth tigers and things of that sort, but there are other dangers too.

788
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,600
 There's the danger of a cut to your skin that could lead to infection.

789
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,840
 There's the danger of storms.

790
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,000
 There's the danger of cold.

791
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,840
 There's the danger of leaving your loved ones behind.

792
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,560
 So you go out and forage.

793
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,040
 You could be hunting, you could be gathering, or you could be doing both.

794
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,600
 The going out and foraging process was we are certain driven by dopamine.

795
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,720
 I mean, there's no fossil record of the brain, but these circuits have existed, we know, for

796
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,280
 tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and they are present in every animal,

797
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,760
 not just mammals, but even in little worms like C. elegans, the same process is mediated

798
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,400
 by dopamine.

799
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,200
 So dopamine drives you to go out and look for things.

800
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,000
 And then let's say you find a couple of berries and these ones are rotten, these ones are

801
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 good.

802
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,760
 Maybe you hunt an animal and kill it, or you find an animal that was recently killed and

803
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,400
 you decide to take the meat.

804
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,640
 You are going to achieve, or I should say experience some sort of dopamine release.

805
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,040
 You found the reward.

806
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,120
 That's great.

807
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,560
 But then it needs to return to some lower level.

808
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
 Why?

809
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,640
 Well, because if you just stayed there, you would never continue to forage for more.

810
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,840
 It doesn't just increase your baseline and then stay there.

811
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,360
 It goes back down.

812
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,940
 And what's very important to understand is that it doesn't just go back down to the level

813
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,640
 it was before.

814
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:18,840
 It goes down to a level below what it was before you went out seeking that thing.

815
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,080
 Now, this is counterintuitive.

816
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,600
 We often think, oh, okay, I'm going to pursue the win.

817
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,360
 All right, let's, let's move this to modern day.

818
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,360
 I'm going to, I'm going to run this marathon.

819
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,640
 I'm going to train for this marathon.

820
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,720
 Then you run the marathon and you finish, you cross the finish line, you feel great.

821
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,200
 And you would think, okay, now I'm set for the entire year.

822
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,200
 I'm going to feel so much better.

823
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,240
 I'm going to feel this accomplishment in my body.

824
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
 It's going to be so great.

825
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,040
 But that's not what happens.

826
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,000
 You might feel some of those things, but your level of dopamine has actually dropped below

827
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 baseline.

828
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,960
 Now, eventually it will ratchet back up, but two things are really important.

829
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,800
 First of all, the extent to which it drops below baseline is proportional to how high

830
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,200
 the peak was.

831
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:06,140
 So if you cross the finish line pretty happy, it won't drop that much below baseline afterward.

832
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:11,700
 If you cross the finish line ecstatic, well a day or two later, you're going to feel quite

833
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,440
 a bit lower than you would otherwise.

834
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,320
 You might not be depressed because it depends on where that baseline was to begin with,

835
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:23,280
 but the so-called postpartum depression that people experience after giving birth or after

836
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:31,240
 some big win, a graduation or any kind of celebration, that postpartum drop in mood and affect and

837
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,200
 motivation is the drop in baseline dopamine.

838
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,040
 This is very important to understand because this happens on very rapid timescales and

839
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,640
 it can last quite a long time.

840
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:47,140
 It also explains the behavior that most of us are familiar with of engaging in something

841
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:52,340
 that we really enjoy going to a restaurant that we absolutely love or engaging in some

842
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,380
 way with some person that we really, really enjoy.

843
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:01,340
 But if we continue to engage in that behavior over and over again, it kind of loses its edge.

844
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:06,580
 It starts to kind of feel less exciting to us.

845
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:13,020
 Some of us experience that drop in excitement more quickly and more severely than others,

846
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,540
 but everyone experiences that to some extent.

847
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:22,400
 And this has direct roots in these evolutionarily conserved circuits.

848
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,520
 Some of you may be hearing this and think, "No, no, no, that's not how it works for me.

849
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,560
 I'm just riding higher and higher all the time.

850
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,560
 I love my kids.

851
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,560
 I love my job.

852
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
 I love school.

853
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,560
 I love wins.

854
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,060
 I don't want losses."

855
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,440
 I agree.

856
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,340
 We all feel good when we are achieving things, but oftentimes we are feeling good because

857
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:45,740
 we are layering in different aspects of life, consuming things and doing things that increase

858
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,740
 our dopamine.

859
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,540
 We're getting those peaks.

860
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:55,020
 But afterward, the drop in baseline occurs and it always takes a little while to get

861
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,280
 back to our stable baseline.

862
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,840
 We really all have a sort of dopamine set point.

863
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,940
 And if we continue to indulge in the same behaviors or even different behaviors that

864
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,120
 increase our dopamine in these big peaks over and over and over again, we won't experience

865
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:16,140
 the same level of joy from those behaviors or from anything at all.

866
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,360
 Now, that has a name.

867
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,800
 It's called addiction, but even for people who aren't addicted, even for people who don't

868
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:28,480
 have an attachment to any specific substance or behavior, this drop in below baseline after

869
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,840
 any peak in dopamine is substantial and it governs whether or not we are going to feel

870
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,520
 motivated to continue to pursue other things.

871
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:42,120
 Fortunately, there's a way to work with this such that we can constantly stay motivated

872
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,400
 but also keep that baseline of dopamine at an appropriate healthy level.

873
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,040
 A previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast was Dr. Anna Lemke.

874
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,760
 She's head of the addiction dual diagnosis clinic at Stanford.

875
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,080
 Has this amazing book, Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.

876
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,280
 If you haven't read the book, I highly encourage you to check it out.

877
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,280
 It's fantastic.

878
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,360
 The other terrific book about dopamine is the molecule of more, which is similar in

879
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,560
 some regard, but isn't so much about addiction.

880
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,000
 It's more about other types of behaviors.

881
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,760
 Both books really focus on these dopamine schedules and the relationship between these

882
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,480
 peaks and baselines of dopamine.

883
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,200
 In Dr. Lemke's book, and when she was on the Huberman Lab podcast and other podcast, she's

884
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,700
 talked about this pleasure pain balance that when we seek something that we really like

885
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,240
 or we indulge in it, like eating a little piece of chocolate, if we really like chocolate,

886
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,680
 there's some pleasure.

887
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:40,240
 But then there's a little bit of pain that exceeds the amount of pleasure and it's subtle

888
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,560
 and we experience it as wanting more of that thing.

889
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,560
 Okay.

890
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,840
 So there's a pleasure pain balance.

891
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:50,600
 And I'm telling you that the pleasure and the pain are governed by dopamine to some extent.

892
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,600
 Well, how could that be?

893
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
 Right?

894
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,600
 So, you know, before when you engage in an activity or when you ingest something that

895
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,960
 increases dopamine, the dopamine levels go up, you know, to substantial degree with all

896
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,360
 the things I listed off.

897
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,680
 Where's the pain coming from?

898
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:12,720
 Well, the pain is coming from the lack of dopamine that follows and you now know what

899
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,160
 that lack of dopamine reflects.

900
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,160
 How do you know?

901
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,160
 Well, earlier we were talking about how dopamine is released between neurons.

902
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,360
 And I mentioned two ways.

903
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,800
 One is into the synapse where it can activate the postsynaptic neuron.

904
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,080
 And the other was what I called volumetric release where it is distributed more broadly.

905
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:35,320
 It's released out over a bunch of neurons.

906
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:40,040
 In both cases, it's released from these things we call synaptic vesicles, literally little

907
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,840
 bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles that contain dopamine.

908
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,760
 They get vomited out into the area or into the synapse.

909
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,200
 Now those vesicles get depleted.

910
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:57,320
 For the synaptic physiologists out there, we call this the readily releasable pool of

911
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,040
 dopamine.

912
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,240
 We can only deploy dopamine that is ready to be deployed, that's packaged in those little

913
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,560
 vesicles and ready to go.

914
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:10,640
 It's like when you order a product and they say out of stock until two months from now,

915
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,560
 well, it's not ready to be released.

916
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,560
 Same thing with dopamine.

917
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:20,120
 The pool of dopamine that's synthesized and you can only release the dopamine that's

918
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,800
 been synthesized is the readily releasable pool.

919
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:29,520
 The pleasure pain balance doesn't only hinge on the readily releasable pool of dopamine,

920
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:36,840
 but a big part of the pleasure pain balance hinges on how much dopamine is there and how

921
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,320
 much is ready and capable of being released into the system.

922
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:47,400
 So now we've given some meat to this thing that we call the pleasure pain balance.

923
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,980
 And now it should make perfect sense why if you take something or do something that leads

924
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:59,080
 to huge increases in dopamine, afterward your baseline should drop because there isn't

925
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,680
 a lot of dopamine around to keep your baseline going.

926
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:10,420
 Fortunately, most people do not experience or pursue enormous increases in dopamine leading

927
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:14,200
 to these severe drops in baseline.

928
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,040
 Many people do, however, and that's what we call addiction.

929
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,960
 When somebody pursues a drug or an activity that leads to huge increases in dopamine,

930
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,040
 and now you understand that afterward the baseline of dopamine drops because of depletion

931
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,840
 of dopamine, the readily releasable pool, the dopamine is literally not around to be

932
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,840
 released.

933
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,240
 And so people feel pretty lousy and many people make the mistake of then going and pursuing

934
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:46,180
 the dopamine evoking the dopamine releasing activity or substance again, thinking mistakenly

935
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,180
 that it's going to bring up their baseline.

936
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,520
 It's going to give them that peak again.

937
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:54,540
 Not only does it not give them a peak, their baseline gets lower and lower because they're

938
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,500
 depleting dopamine more and more and more.

939
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:02,220
 And we've seen this over and over again when people get addicted to something, then they're

940
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,940
 not achieving much pleasure at all.

941
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,540
 You can even see this with video games.

942
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,920
 People will play a video game.

943
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,080
 They love it.

944
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,600
 It's super exciting to them.

945
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,500
 And then they'll keep playing and playing and playing.

946
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,800
 And either one of two things happens, typically both.

947
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:25,280
 First of all, I always say addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure.

948
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,040
 So oftentimes what will happen is the person only has excitement and can achieve dopamine

949
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:35,260
 release to the same extent doing that behavior and not other behaviors.

950
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,580
 And so they start losing interest in school.

951
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,940
 They start losing interest in relationships.

952
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:45,100
 They start losing interest in fitness and well-being and depletes their life.

953
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:50,620
 And eventually what typically happens is they will stop getting dopamine release from that

954
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,380
 activity as well.

955
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,300
 And then they drop into a pretty serious depression.

956
01:01:55,300 --> 01:02:01,880
 This can get very severe and people have committed suicide from these sorts of patterns of activity.

957
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,320
 But what about the more typical scenario?

958
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:10,160
 What about the scenario of somebody who is really good at working during the week, they

959
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,480
 exercise during the week, they drink on the weekends?

960
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:18,240
 Well, that person is only consuming alcohol, maybe one or two nights a week.

961
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,760
 But oftentimes that same person will be spiking their dopamine with food during the middle

962
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,760
 of the week.

963
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,260
 Now we all have to eat and it's nice to eat foods that we enjoy.

964
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,260
 I certainly do that.

965
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,600
 I love food in fact.

966
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,540
 But let's say they're eating foods that really evoke a lot of dopamine release in the middle

967
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,540
 of the week.

968
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,940
 They're drinking one or two days on the weekend.

969
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,660
 They are one of these work hard, play hard types.

970
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:48,340
 So they're swimming a couple of miles in the ocean in the middle of the week as well.

971
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,060
 They're going out dancing once on the weekend.

972
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,580
 Sounds like a pretty, pretty balanced life as I describe it.

973
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:56,160
 Well, here's the problem.

974
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:01,920
 The problem is that dopamine is not just evoked by one of these activities.

975
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,600
 Dopamine is evoked by all of these activities.

976
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:11,400
 And dopamine is one currency of craving motivation and desire and pleasure.

977
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,640
 There's only one currency.

978
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:18,440
 So even though if you look at the activities, you'd say, well, it's just on the weekends

979
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,440
 or this thing is only a couple of times a week.

980
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:27,100
 If you looked at dopamine simply as a function, as a chemical function of peaks and baseline,

981
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,620
 it might make sense why this person after several years of work hard, play hard would

982
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:33,940
 say, yeah, you know, I'm feeling kind of burnt out.

983
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:37,540
 I'm just not feeling like I have the same energy that I did a few years ago.

984
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:42,640
 And of course there are age related reasons why people can experience drops in energy.

985
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,260
 But oftentimes what's happening is not some sort of depletion and cellular metabolism that's

986
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,260
 related to aging.

987
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:53,360
 What's happening is they're spiking their dopamine through so many different activities

988
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,480
 throughout the week that their baseline is progressively dropping.

989
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,680
 And in this case, it can be very subtle.

990
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,000
 It can be very, very subtle.

991
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,760
 And that's actually a very sinister function of dopamine, we could say, which is that

992
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,880
 it can often drop in imperceptible ways.

993
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,760
 But then once it reaches a threshold of low dopamine, you just feel like, hmm, we can't

994
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,780
 really get pleasure from anything anymore.

995
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,560
 It used to work, doesn't work anymore.

996
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:25,080
 So it starts to look a lot like the more severe addictions or the more acute addictions to

997
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,960
 things like cocaine and amphetamine, which leads to these big increases, these big spikes

998
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,000
 in dopamine, and then these very severe drops in the baseline.

999
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,240
 Now, of course, we all should engage in activities that we enjoy.

1000
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,840
 I certainly do, everybody should.

1001
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:44,840
 A huge part of life is pursuing activities and things that we enjoy.

1002
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,860
 The key thing is to understand this relationship between the peaks and the baseline and to

1003
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,180
 understand how they influence one another.

1004
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:55,300
 Because once you do that, you can start to make really good choices in the short run

1005
01:04:55,300 --> 01:05:00,900
 and in the long run to maintain your level of dopamine baseline, maybe even raise that

1006
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:06,860
 level of dopamine baseline and still get those peaks and still achieve those feelings of

1007
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:10,260
 elevated motivation, elevated desire and craving.

1008
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:17,840
 Because again, those peaks and having a sufficiently healthy high level of dopamine baseline are

1009
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,800
 what drove the evolution of our species and they're really what drive the evolution of

1010
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,880
 anyone's life progression too.

1011
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,960
 So they're a good thing.

1012
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,560
 Dopamine is a good thing.

1013
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:31,240
 Just very briefly, because it was also covered in the interview episode I did with Anna Lemke

1014
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,720
 about addiction.

1015
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:37,880
 Some of you might be asking, what should I do if I experience a drop in my baseline level

1016
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:43,380
 of dopamine because of engagement with some activity or some substance that led to big

1017
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,420
 peaks?

1018
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:50,980
 Just to put some color and example on this, a few episodes ago I talked about a friend

1019
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:51,980
 who I've known a long time.

1020
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:57,620
 This is actually the child of a friend who has basically become addicted to video games.

1021
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:03,780
 He decided actually after seeing that episode with Anna to do a 30 day complete fast from

1022
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,700
 phone, from video games and from social media of all kinds.

1023
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,080
 He's now at day 29.

1024
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,360
 He's really accomplished this.

1025
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,720
 Not incidentally, his levels of concentration, his overall mood are up.

1026
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,040
 He's doing far, far better.

1027
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,760
 What he did is hard in particular the first 14 days is really hard.

1028
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:26,080
 But the way that you replenish the releasable pool of dopamine is to not engage in these

1029
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,320
 dopaminergic seeking behaviors.

1030
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,360
 Because remember, typically people arrive at a place where they want to stop engaging

1031
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,360
 in these behaviors or ingesting substances when that dopamine is depleted, when they're

1032
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,700
 not getting the same lift.

1033
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,340
 In his case, he was feeling depressed.

1034
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,340
 He thought he had ADHD.

1035
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,540
 They were starting to treat it as ADHD.

1036
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:48,300
 And certainly there are people out there who have ADHD, but what he found was that his

1037
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,740
 levels of concentration are back.

1038
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,780
 He does not need to be treated for ADHD.

1039
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,820
 And actually the psychiatrist wondered if he did prior to this video game, social media

1040
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,220
 fast.

1041
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,220
 He's feeling good.

1042
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,900
 He's exercising again.

1043
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:01,900
 Not making this up.

1044
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:09,480
 It's really a very specific, but very relevant example of how the dopamine system can replenish

1045
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,480
 itself.

1046
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,840
 Of course, if there's a clinical need for ADHD treatment, by all means pursue that.

1047
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:21,520
 But I think a lot of ADHD does go misdiagnosed because of this depletion in dopamine that

1048
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,800
 occurs because of overindulgence and other activities in the drop in baseline.

1049
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:31,400
 So for anyone that's experienced a real drop in baseline who has addictive tendencies, whether

1050
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:37,060
 or not their behaviors or substances, that is always going to be the path forward is

1051
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:42,740
 going to be either cold turkey or through some sort of tapering to limit interactions

1052
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:47,540
 with the, what would otherwise be the dopamine evoking behavior or substance.

1053
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:54,700
 So let's talk about the optimal way to engage in activities or to consume things that evoke

1054
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,860
 dopamine.

1055
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:58,380
 And by no means am I encouraging people to take drugs of abuse.

1056
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,380
 I would not do that.

1057
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,740
 I am not doing that.

1058
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:07,280
 But some of the things on these lists of dopamine evoking activities are things like chocolate,

1059
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:15,160
 coffee, even if it's indirect, sex and reproduction provided it's healthy, consensual, context appropriate,

1060
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:20,800
 age appropriate, species appropriate, of course, is central to our evolution and progression

1061
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,960
 as a species.

1062
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:26,840
 So certain things like cocaine and amphetamine, I will put in the classification of bad.

1063
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
 I'm willing to do that.

1064
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:32,720
 And other things are part of life, food, exercise, if that evokes your dopamine, how

1065
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:37,640
 are we supposed to engage with these dopamine evoking activities in ways that are healthy

1066
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,640
 and beneficial for us?

1067
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,480
 How do we achieve these peaks, which are so central to our well-being and experience of

1068
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,360
 life without dropping our baseline?

1069
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:50,340
 And the key lies in intermittent release of dopamine.

1070
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:58,740
 The real key is to not expect or chase high levels of dopamine release every time we engage

1071
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:02,400
 in these activities.

1072
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:08,860
 Intermittent reward schedules are the central schedule by which casinos keep you gambling,

1073
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:14,480
 the central schedule by which elusive partners or potential partners keep you texting and

1074
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,160
 pursuing on either side of the relationship.

1075
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:27,060
 Evolution schedules are the way that the internet and social media and all highly engaging activities

1076
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,580
 keep you motivated and pursuing.

1077
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:37,380
 And we can take this back to our evolutionary adaptive scenario where you are out there

1078
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:45,340
 looking for water, looking for food, not every trail, not every pursuit, not every hunch about

1079
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:50,300
 where the animals will be, where the food will be, where the berries will be, not every

1080
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,260
 single one of those played out.

1081
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,720
 There's something called dopamine reward prediction error.

1082
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:02,040
 When we expect something to happen, we are highly motivated to pursue it.

1083
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,760
 If it happens, great, we get the reward.

1084
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,000
 The reward comes in various chemical forms, including dopamine, and we are more likely

1085
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,140
 to engage in that behavior again.

1086
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,660
 This is the basis of casino gambling.

1087
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:17,520
 This is how they keep you going back again and again and again, even though on average,

1088
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,800
 the house really does win.

1089
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,720
 You can transplant that example to any number of different pleasurable activities.

1090
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,280
 If you're not a gambler and that doesn't appeal to you, I have to imagine there's something

1091
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,080
 that appeals to you, something that you do repeatedly because you enjoy it.

1092
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:37,320
 And almost inevitably, it's because there's an intermittent schedule.

1093
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:42,400
 There's a intermittent schedule by which dopamine sometimes arrives, sometimes a little bit,

1094
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,100
 sometimes a lot, sometimes a medium amount.

1095
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:52,380
 That intermittent reinforcement schedule is actually the best schedule to export to other

1096
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,700
 activities.

1097
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,700
 How do you do that?

1098
01:10:54,700 --> 01:11:01,900
 Well, first of all, if you are engaged in activities, school, sport, relationship, etc.,

1099
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:07,420
 where you experience a win, you should be very careful about allowing yourself to experience

1100
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:14,080
 huge peaks in dopamine unless you're willing to suffer the crash that follows and waiting

1101
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,200
 a period of time for it to come back up.

1102
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,040
 What would this look like in the practical sense?

1103
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,920
 Well, let's say you are somebody who really does enjoy exercise, or let's say you're

1104
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:27,200
 somebody who kind of likes exercise but forces yourself to do it, but you make it pleasure

1105
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,080
 full by giving yourself your favorite cup of coffee first, or maybe taking a pre-workout

1106
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,120
 drink, or taking an energy drink, or listening to your favorite music, and then you're in

1107
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,340
 the gym and you're listening to your music, that all sounds great, right?

1108
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:43,620
 Well, it is great except that by layering together all these things to try and achieve

1109
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:48,820
 that dopamine release, and by getting a big peak in dopamine, you're actually increasing

1110
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:53,900
 the number of conditions required to achieve pleasure from that activity again.

1111
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:58,380
 And so there is a form of this where sometimes you do all the things that you love to get

1112
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,420
 the optimal workout.

1113
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:02,980
 You listen to your favorite music, you go at your favorite time of day, you have your

1114
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:07,480
 pre-workout drink if that's your thing, you do all the things that give you that best

1115
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:11,440
 experience of the workout for you.

1116
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,880
 But there's also a version of this where sometimes you don't do the dopamine enhancing

1117
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:17,880
 activities.

1118
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,040
 You don't ingest anything to increase your dopamine.

1119
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,960
 You just do the exercise.

1120
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,880
 You don't do the exercise and expect dopamine to arrive through some what we call exogenous

1121
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,040
 source as well.

1122
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,860
 And I think, well, that sounds lame.

1123
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,380
 I want to continue to enjoy exercising.

1124
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:37,940
 Ah, but that's exactly the point.

1125
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:42,340
 If you want to maintain motivation for school exercise relationships or pursuits of any

1126
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:48,300
 duration in kind, the key thing is to make sure that the peak in dopamine, if it's very

1127
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,580
 high, doesn't occur too often.

1128
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:58,060
 And if something does occur very often that you vary how much dopamine you experience with

1129
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,360
 each engagement in that activity.

1130
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:05,360
 Now some activities naturally have this intermittent property woven into them.

1131
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,440
 We sometimes have classes that we like in other classes we don't like.

1132
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,800
 We don't always get straight A's.

1133
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,800
 Sometimes we don't get rewarded with the outcome that we would like.

1134
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,160
 We don't always have the perfect relationship outcome.

1135
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,520
 But understand that your ability to experience motivation and pleasure for what comes next

1136
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:29,740
 is dictated by how much motivation and pleasure and dopamine you experienced prior.

1137
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:34,940
 The reason I can't give a very specific protocol like delete dopamine or lower dopamine every

1138
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:38,340
 third time is that that wouldn't be intermittent.

1139
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:44,460
 The whole basis of intermittent reinforcement is that you don't really have a specific schedule

1140
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:48,700
 of when dopamine is going to be high and when dopamine is going to be low and when dopamine

1141
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,060
 is going to be medium.

1142
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:54,040
 That's a predictable schedule, not a random intermittent schedule.

1143
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,440
 So do like the casinos do, certainly works for them.

1144
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:02,080
 And four activities that you would like to continue to engage in over time, whatever

1145
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,920
 those happen to be, start paying attention to the amount of dopamine and excitement and

1146
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,160
 pleasure that you achieve with those and start modulating that somewhat at random.

1147
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:18,320
 That might be removing some of the dopamine releasing chemicals that you might take prior.

1148
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:23,980
 You remove them every time, but then every once in a while you introduce them.

1149
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:29,260
 Maybe it involves sometimes doing things socially that you enjoy doing socially, sometimes doing

1150
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,020
 the same thing, but alone.

1151
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,300
 There are a lot of different ways to do this.

1152
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,440
 There are a lot of different ways to approach this.

1153
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:41,820
 But now knowing what you know about peaks and baselines and dopamine and understanding how

1154
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:46,100
 important it is not just to achieve peaks, but to maintain that baseline at a healthy

1155
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,100
 level.

1156
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,000
 So I look forward for you to implement these intermittent schedules.

1157
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,960
 For those of you that are begging for more specificity, we can give you a tool.

1158
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:01,440
 One would be you can flip a coin before engaging in any of these types of activities and decide

1159
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:08,680
 whether or not you are going to allow other dopamine supportive elements to go, for instance,

1160
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,680
 into the gym with you.

1161
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,040
 Are you going to listen to music or not?

1162
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,720
 If you enjoy listening to music, well, then flip a coin.

1163
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,360
 And if it comes up heads, bring the music in.

1164
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,780
 If it comes up tails, don't.

1165
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,780
 Okay.

1166
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:22,260
 Sounds like you're undercutting your own progress, but actually you are serving your

1167
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:25,820
 own progress, both short-term and long-term by doing that.

1168
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:32,060
 Now the smartphone is a very interesting tool for dopamine in light of all this.

1169
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:38,260
 It's extremely common nowadays to see people texting and doing selfies and communicating

1170
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:43,020
 in various ways, listening to podcasts, listening to music, doing all sorts of things while they

1171
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:44,460
 engage in other activities.

1172
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:48,920
 They're going to dinner and texting other people or making plans, sharing information.

1173
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,920
 That's all wonderful.

1174
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:56,840
 It gives depth and richness and color to life, but it isn't just about our distracted nature

1175
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,600
 when we're engaging with the phone.

1176
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,640
 It's also a way of layering in dopamine.

1177
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:11,520
 And it's no surprise that levels of depression and lack of motivation are really on the increase.

1178
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:17,540
 Everything that we've talked about until now sets up an explanation or an interpretation

1179
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:24,380
 of why interacting with digital technology can potentially lead to disruptions or lowering

1180
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:28,880
 in baseline levels of dopamine.

1181
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,620
 I can use a personal example for this.

1182
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,220
 I happen to really enjoy working out.

1183
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,180
 I've always really enjoyed it.

1184
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:40,340
 But in recent years, I noticed that if I was bringing my phone to my workouts, then not

1185
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:44,000
 only was I a little bit more distracted and not focusing on what I was doing as much as

1186
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,520
 I could have or should have, but also I started to lose interest in what I was doing.

1187
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,840
 It wasn't as pleasurable.

1188
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:54,760
 I would feel like it just didn't have the same kind of oomph and I was beginning to question

1189
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,980
 my motivation.

1190
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:02,160
 As I started learning more about this relationship between the peaks and the baselines and dopamine,

1191
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:07,480
 what I realized was that some time ago, I probably experienced an incredible increase

1192
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:12,660
 in the amount of dopamine during one of my workouts because I enjoy working out and I

1193
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:13,780
 enjoy listening to music.

1194
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:15,300
 I also enjoy listening to podcasts.

1195
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,500
 I also enjoy communicating with people.

1196
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:22,460
 Those are all wonderful pursuits, but I had layered in too many of them too many times

1197
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:27,420
 and then it essentially wasn't working for me anymore, much in the same way a drug wouldn't

1198
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:31,620
 work for somebody who takes it repeatedly because their baseline of dopamine is dropping.

1199
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:36,980
 So at least for this calendar year, I've made a rule for myself, which is I don't allow

1200
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:40,680
 my phone into my workouts at all.

1201
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,600
 No music, at least not from the phone.

1202
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,600
 It can be in the room.

1203
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:50,040
 I might listen to a podcast in the room, but I don't listen to anything or engage in anything

1204
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,560
 on my phone, no texting whatsoever.

1205
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,560
 And most of the time I just don't even bring it with me for that period of time.

1206
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,360
 It's only a short period of time.

1207
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:59,920
 I'm not training that often.

1208
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:06,680
 This is something that I think has been misinterpreted as people can't be alone now.

1209
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:12,060
 People talk about, oh, you know, they can't walk across the street or they can't go anywhere,

1210
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,740
 ride the bus, can't be on the plane without being in contact.

1211
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:17,380
 They can't handle just their thoughts.

1212
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,140
 I don't think that's really what's going on.

1213
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:24,340
 I think what's happened is that we achieved the great dopamine increase that comes from

1214
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:29,660
 this incredible thing, which I personally enjoy being able to communicate by phone, by text

1215
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,660
 and exchange pictures and send links and these kinds of things, social media.

1216
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:39,360
 But then what happens is it doesn't have that same fulfilling aspect to it and it tends

1217
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,840
 to remove the excitement and the pleasure of the very activities that we are engaged

1218
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,840
 in.

1219
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:51,040
 So I know this is a hard one for many people, but I do invite you to try removing multiple

1220
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:56,440
 sources of dopamine release or what used to be multiple sources of dopamine release from

1221
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,920
 activities that you want to continue to enjoy or that you want to enjoy more.

1222
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:05,860
 And now you understand the biological mechanisms that would underlie a statement like that.

1223
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:07,780
 It takes a little bit of working with.

1224
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:12,740
 I know it can be challenging in the first week or so of not engaging with the phone

1225
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:14,380
 during any kind of workout.

1226
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:18,780
 That actually was really tough, but now I'm back to a place where I enjoy it that much

1227
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:19,780
 more.

1228
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:23,260
 I also feel as if I conquered something in terms of the circuitry related to dopamine.

1229
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:29,260
 I now understand why something that I enjoyed so much had become less pleasurable for me

1230
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:33,160
 and there's a deep, deep satisfaction that comes from understanding, okay, there wasn't

1231
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:38,480
 anything wrong with me or the, what I was doing or anything at all.

1232
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:42,200
 It was just a, there was something wrong with the approach I was taking, which was layering

1233
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,600
 in all these sources of dopamine and dropping my baseline for this very same reason.

1234
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:54,040
 I cautioned people against using stimulants every time they study or every time they work

1235
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:59,240
 out or every time that they do anything that they would like to continue to enjoy and be

1236
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,060
 motivated at.

1237
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:06,780
 There's one exception, which is caffeine because I mentioned before, if you like caffeine,

1238
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:10,140
 that actually could be a good thing for your dopamine system because it does up regulate

1239
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,820
 these D2D3 receptors.

1240
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:17,140
 So it actually makes whatever dopamine is released by that activity more accessible

1241
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:23,140
 or more functional within the biochemistry and the pathways of your brain and body.

1242
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:28,540
 However, a number of energy drinks and in particular pre workouts contain things that

1243
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:34,080
 are precursors to dopamine and on their own, even if you didn't engage in the activity,

1244
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,800
 would cause the release of dopamine to a substantial degree.

1245
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,960
 They do cause the release of dopamine to a substantial degree and over time that will

1246
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,240
 deplete your dopamine.

1247
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:51,200
 So energy drinks, pre workout drinks, drugs of various kinds that people take to study

1248
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,200
 and pay attention.

1249
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:57,080
 We talked about some of these for the ADHD episode, things like Adderall, Ritalin, Armodaffinil,

1250
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:04,140
 taken repeatedly over time will reduce the level of satisfaction and joy that you get

1251
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:10,100
 from the activities you engage in while under the influence of those compounds.

1252
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,100
 I'm not trying to demonize those compounds for their clinical use.

1253
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:17,540
 What I'm saying is taking stimulants and then engaging in activities that you would like

1254
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:23,100
 to continue to feel pleasurable is undercutting the process and inevitably might not happen

1255
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:27,880
 tomorrow, might not happen in a month, but inevitably you will have challenges with motivation

1256
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,560
 and drive related to those activities.

1257
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,280
 Now some people can keep it right in check.

1258
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:37,200
 They can just do the one can of the energy drink or they only do their pre workout before

1259
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,440
 really hard days.

1260
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,400
 For instance, more power to you.

1261
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:47,760
 I actually do that sometimes, frankly, but people who are trying to get into that peak,

1262
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:53,000
 super motivated, driven, driven state really focused every time they engage in an activity.

1263
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,120
 You are absolutely undercutting the process and you are undermining your ability to stay

1264
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,040
 motivated and focused.

1265
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:06,420
 So just as we talked about intermittent reward schedules a moment ago, intermittent spiking

1266
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:11,880
 of dopamine, if you do it at all is definitely the way to go and chronically trying to spike

1267
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:17,640
 your dopamine in order to enhance your motivation, focus and drive will absolutely undermine

1268
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,960
 your motivation, focus and drive in the long run.

1269
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:27,400
 Meditation of caffeine is somewhat of an exception among the other examples of things I've mentioned

1270
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:34,880
 to avoid before what would otherwise be dopamine increasing activities because again, caffeine

1271
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,720
 can increase the density and the efficacy of these dopamine receptors.

1272
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:47,720
 Turns out that the source of caffeine could also matter while coffee or tea or other forms

1273
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:52,840
 of caffeine will have this effect of increasing dopamine receptors.

1274
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:58,360
 Yerba mate, something I've talked about before on this podcast has some interesting properties.

1275
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,040
 First of all, it contains caffeine.

1276
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,080
 It's also high in antioxidants.

1277
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,880
 It also contains something called GLP one, which is favorable for management of blood

1278
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,320
 sugar levels.

1279
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:17,160
 Yerba mate, it turns out, has also been shown to be neuro protective specifically for dopaminergic

1280
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,160
 neurons.

1281
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:21,960
 Now I should mention this is just a couple of studies, so we don't want to conclude too

1282
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:27,800
 much from these studies, more need to be done, but they showed that in a model of damage

1283
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:33,280
 to dopamine neurons, ingestion of Yerba mate and some of the compounds within Yerba mate

1284
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:38,520
 can actually serve to preserve the survival of dopamine neurons in both the movement-related

1285
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,400
 pathway and the motivation pathway.

1286
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:46,560
 So perhaps you need that incentive in order to ingest Yerba mate tea.

1287
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,280
 Perhaps you don't need any incentive.

1288
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,720
 In my case, I don't need any incentive.

1289
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:54,160
 I already enjoy Yerba mate as my principal source of caffeine, although I do drink coffee

1290
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,320
 as well.

1291
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:00,040
 But if one were going to consume caffeine, you might consider consuming that caffeine

1292
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:05,400
 in the form of Yerba mate, both for sake of up regulating dopamine receptors and getting

1293
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,120
 more of a dopamine increase.

1294
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:12,840
 And of course for the stimulant properties of caffeine, if that's what you're seeking.

1295
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:18,480
 And in addition to that, because Yerba mate does appear to have some sort of neuro protective

1296
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:22,200
 and a particular dopamine neuron protective properties.

1297
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,640
 Now that doesn't mean that caffeine is always beneficial.

1298
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:29,440
 And actually there's one instance related to dopamine where caffeine can be particularly

1299
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,880
 dangerous.

1300
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,080
 This relates to MDMA, so-called ecstasy.

1301
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:39,520
 MDMA is under investigation in various clinical trials for its potential to treat trauma and

1302
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,040
 depression.

1303
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,920
 It's also of course a drug that's used recreationally.

1304
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:50,240
 It's still illegal, at least in the United States.

1305
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:54,120
 Whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic has been very controversial.

1306
01:24:54,120 --> 01:25:00,080
 Early on it was thought that it is neurotoxic, that it can destroy serotonergic neurons.

1307
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:04,840
 There were other papers that came out which argued that's not the case.

1308
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:10,280
 And that's in particular because one of the early papers published in Science Magazine

1309
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,600
 claiming that MDMA was neurotoxic.

1310
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,760
 That paper was retracted.

1311
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:20,200
 It turns out that that study had mistakenly used methamphetamine instead and methamphetamine

1312
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,440
 is known to be neurotoxic.

1313
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:28,400
 I think most of the data point to the idea that MDMA might not be neurotoxic, but in

1314
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:34,120
 any case caffeine has been shown to increase the toxicity of MDMA receptors.

1315
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,800
 And you might say, "Wow, could that be?"

1316
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,880
 Well, now you understand why that could be.

1317
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:45,040
 Caffeine increases the density and efficacy of these dopamine receptors, the D2 and D3

1318
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,040
 receptors.

1319
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:52,640
 MDMA is a potent drug for increasing concentrations of dopamine as well as serotonin and other

1320
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,160
 neuromodulators.

1321
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:58,840
 And it appears that caffeine ingestion by up regulating these receptors can lead to

1322
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:02,560
 more toxicity of MDMA.

1323
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:08,720
 So caffeine can be a beneficial substance in one context and actually can be a detrimental

1324
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:12,040
 if not dangerous substance in another context.

1325
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:18,280
 Two substances that greatly increase dopamine, namely amphetamine and cocaine, can cause

1326
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:22,800
 long-term problems with the dopaminergic pathways.

1327
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:28,200
 And this is largely based on a study that was published some years ago, 2003, but still

1328
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,920
 holds a lot of merit.

1329
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:35,080
 This is a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a very high

1330
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,160
 tier stringent journal.

1331
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,000
 First author is Colb KOLB.

1332
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,960
 And the title of the paper pretty much tells the story.

1333
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,840
 Amphetamine or cocaine limits the ability of later experience to promote structural plasticity

1334
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,960
 in the neocortex and nucleus accumbens.

1335
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:54,240
 Neocortex is the outer shell of the brain more or less.

1336
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:59,560
 And the nucleus accumbens is part of that mesolimbic dopamine pathway for motivation,

1337
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:02,160
 drive and reinforcement.

1338
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,160
 Neuroplasticity of course is the brain's ability to change in response to experience

1339
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:12,320
 and neuroplasticity is the basis of learning and memory and essentially remodeling of our

1340
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,680
 neural circuitry in positive ways of all kinds.

1341
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:21,720
 And this study was really one of the first to show that ingesting amphetamine and cocaine

1342
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:28,080
 because of the high peak in dopamine that it creates and the low dopamine state, the

1343
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:34,560
 baseline drop that it creates afterwards limits plasticity and learning subsequent to taking

1344
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,360
 amphetamine and cocaine.

1345
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:40,320
 It was at least in this study shown to be a long lasting effect.

1346
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:45,560
 I doubt it's a permanent effect, but this should serve as a serious cautionary note that

1347
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,640
 amphetamine and cocaine not only can cause a drop in baseline dopamine, but can actually

1348
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:55,520
 put the brain into a state in which it cannot learn and modify itself to get better at least

1349
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,400
 for some period of time.

1350
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:03,480
 In a previous episode on ADHD, I talked about the widespread use of drugs like Adderall,

1351
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:07,800
 Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, all of which lead to very large increases in dopamine

1352
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:12,840
 and for people with ADHD can really improve their symptoms.

1353
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:18,120
 But of course, there's a lot of non-prescription, non-clinical use of those compounds as well.

1354
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:23,080
 And it stands to reason that the use of those substances to increase dopamine could very

1355
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:28,280
 well provide the same sort of blockade of neuroplasticity that cocaine and amphetamine

1356
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:32,800
 do because when you look at the amount of dopamine increase that's triggered by those

1357
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,440
 compounds, it's really comparable.

1358
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:41,480
 So again, a cautionary note against spiking one's dopamine too much on a regular basis

1359
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,600
 unless there's a valid clinical need for doing that.

1360
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,200
 So we've been focusing a lot for the last few minutes on the kind of darker side of

1361
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,680
 dopamine and how getting big peaks in dopamine can be detrimental.

1362
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:59,200
 But I want to acknowledge the truth, which is that dopamine feels great.

1363
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:03,480
 Being in pursuit and motivated and craving things feels wonderful.

1364
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,480
 And I don't want to demonize dopamine.

1365
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:09,600
 What I'm trying to do today is to illustrate how dopamine works in your brain so that you

1366
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:15,920
 can continue to engage in dopamine evoking activities.

1367
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,340
 And certainly there is a place for ingesting things that can increase dopamine provided

1368
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:25,400
 that they are safe for us in the short and long term.

1369
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:31,680
 There are activities that we can do that will give us healthy sustained increases in dopamine,

1370
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:37,800
 both the peaks when they happen and to maintain or even increase our baseline levels of dopamine.

1371
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,280
 So how do we do that?

1372
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,160
 What are some of these activities?

1373
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:47,720
 Well, in recent years, there's been a trend toward more people doing so-called cold exposure.

1374
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:54,120
 In part, this was popularized by Wim Hof, the so-called Iceman, getting into cold showers,

1375
01:29:54,120 --> 01:30:00,440
 taking ice baths, exposing oneself to cold water of various kinds, can in fact increase

1376
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:05,600
 our levels of dopamine as well as the neuromodulator, neuropinephrine.

1377
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,520
 This is not a new phenomenon.

1378
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:14,480
 In the 1920s, a guy by the name of Vincent Prisnitz was one of the first people to popularize

1379
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,560
 and formalize cold water therapies.

1380
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:23,240
 He was an advocate of cold water exposure in order to boost the immune system and increase

1381
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,680
 feelings of well-being.

1382
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:30,440
 And actually this practice dates back long before Vincent's popularized it.

1383
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,560
 And Wim Hof is the more recent iteration of this.

1384
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,680
 First of all, some of the safety parameters.

1385
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,800
 Let's establish those first.

1386
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:41,520
 Getting into very, very cold water, you know, 30 degree Fahrenheit or even low 40 degree

1387
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,560
 Fahrenheit can put somebody into a state of cold water shock.

1388
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,560
 I mean, people can die doing that.

1389
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,720
 So obviously you want to approach this with some caution.

1390
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:55,640
 But for most people, getting into 60 degree water or 50 degree water or if you're acclimated

1391
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:01,520
 and comfortable with it, you know, 40 degree water or 45 degree water can have tremendously

1392
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:07,880
 beneficial results on your neuromodulator systems, including dopamine.

1393
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:12,680
 What temperature of water you can tolerate will depend on how cold water adapted you

1394
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:17,240
 are and how familiar you are with the experience of getting into cold water.

1395
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:21,600
 And when I say comfortable with, I should mention there is never a case in which getting

1396
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:27,720
 into cold water does not evoke a release of epinephrine.

1397
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:31,920
 So the quickening of the breath, the widening of the eyes, the feeling is if you can't

1398
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:36,600
 catch your breath and even some physical pain at the level of the skin, that happens almost

1399
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,280
 every time or every time that you get into cold water, even if you're cold water adapted.

1400
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:46,400
 What almost everybody knows and understands is that that wall, as I like to refer to it,

1401
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,400
 is coming.

1402
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,200
 That's always the first experience of getting into cold water.

1403
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,520
 There's no real way around that.

1404
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:57,480
 Now this study that I mentioned earlier, human physiological responses to immersion

1405
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,400
 into water of different temperatures.

1406
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:04,040
 Really interesting study that was done and published in the University of, excuse me,

1407
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:06,200
 the European Journal of Applied Physiology.

1408
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:09,800
 I can provide a link to that study in the show caption.

1409
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,040
 It's a really interesting study.

1410
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:16,800
 They looked at people getting exposed to water that was warm, moderately cold or very cold.

1411
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,200
 It was 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius or 14 degrees Celsius.

1412
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,840
 You can just put those online and do the conversion or you can do the conversion to Fahrenheit

1413
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:25,920
 if you like.

1414
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,760
 But in any case, what they looked at were the concentrations of things like epinephrine

1415
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,200
 and dopamine and so on.

1416
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,640
 What they found was really interesting.

1417
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:47,160
 First of all, upon getting into cold water, the changes in adrenaline and noradrenaline,

1418
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:52,160
 and norepinephrine were immediate and fast and these were huge increases.

1419
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:56,120
 So that's the getting into the cold water that everybody experiences these huge increases

1420
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,400
 in adrenaline.

1421
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:02,480
 But then what was interesting is they observed that dopamine levels started to rise somewhat

1422
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:10,960
 slowly and then continued to rise and reach levels as high as 2.5 times above baseline.

1423
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,800
 That's a remarkably high increase.

1424
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:19,380
 Remember if we go back to our examples of chocolate, sex, a doubling above baseline,

1425
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:26,480
 nicotine, 2.5 times above baseline, cocaine, the increase in dopamine from a cold water

1426
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:33,600
 exposure of this kind was comparable to what one sees from cocaine, except, except in this

1427
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,700
 case it wasn't a rise and crash.

1428
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:42,440
 It was actually a sustained rise in dopamine that took a very long time up to three hours

1429
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:46,320
 to come back down to baseline, which is really remarkable.

1430
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:52,520
 And I think this explains some of the positive mental and physical effects that people report

1431
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:55,520
 subjectively after doing cold water exposure.

1432
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,520
 One question that many of you are probably asking is just how cold should the water be?

1433
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:04,100
 Well, you could mimic what was done in this study and do 14 degrees Celsius, but for some

1434
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:07,700
 people that won't be cold enough or some people that will be too cold.

1435
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:11,880
 They did look at the release of stress hormones like cortisol in addition to the release of

1436
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,160
 things like epinephrine and adrenaline.

1437
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:18,640
 And it's interesting that they noted that in all cases, but especially at that coldest

1438
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:23,080
 temperature, there was an increase in cortisol, but that it was transient, that eventually

1439
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:26,920
 people's cortisol, the stress hormone subsided a bit.

1440
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:32,000
 There are basically two different approaches to remaining in the cold when it's uncomfortable.

1441
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,640
 One is to try and relax yourself, to try and practice slow breathing, to try and dilate

1442
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,640
 your gaze.

1443
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,240
 I've talked about this before in previous podcasts, to go into panoramic vision, to

1444
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:46,840
 essentially try and calm yourself so that it's not as stressful in the cold.

1445
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:52,440
 Other people, however, take the approach of trying to ramp up their level of internal

1446
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:57,720
 autonomic arousal, meaning to get really energized and kind of lean into the friction of the

1447
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,920
 cold and they find that easier.

1448
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,200
 Other people distract themselves.

1449
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:06,320
 They recite the alphabet or they do something, anything to try and distract themselves from

1450
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,120
 the discomfort.

1451
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,760
 To be totally honest, it does not matter for sake of dopamine release because the dopamine

1452
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:18,000
 release is triggered and then continues even after you get out of the cold water.

1453
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,360
 Now in this study, it was long exposure to cold water.

1454
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:24,240
 It was an hour.

1455
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,840
 That's a long period of time.

1456
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:31,040
 And I do warn you against getting into cold water that's so cold that it will make your

1457
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,920
 temperature drop and make you hyperthermic for an hour.

1458
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,520
 That actually could be dangerous for a lot of people.

1459
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,640
 You might have a hard time reheating and hypothermia is not a good thing.

1460
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:44,080
 They had people monitoring subjects in these studies and paying attention to their core

1461
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,320
 body temperature.

1462
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:48,000
 They were able to reheat them afterwards.

1463
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,240
 It's well established now that getting into cold water, whether or not it's a shower,

1464
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:58,440
 an ice bath, circulating cold water, a stream, et cetera, that can evoke the norepinephrine

1465
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,720
 release immediately and the long arc of that dopamine release.

1466
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,720
 Why would that be good?

1467
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:08,640
 Up until now, I've basically said getting increases in dopamine are detrimental to your

1468
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,640
 baseline.

1469
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:14,360
 Well, this does appear to raise the baseline of dopamine for substantial periods of time.

1470
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:21,160
 And most people report feeling a heightened level of calm and focus after getting out

1471
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,200
 of cold water.

1472
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:27,400
 So cold water exposure turns out to be a very potent stimulus for shifting the entire milieu,

1473
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:33,920
 the entire environment of our brain and body and allowing many people to feel much, much

1474
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:39,640
 better for a substantial period of time after getting out of the ice bath or cold water

1475
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,800
 of any kind than they did before.

1476
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:44,560
 Now, you might ask how often to do this?

1477
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,120
 Some people do this every day.

1478
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:47,400
 It can be very stimulating.

1479
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,800
 So typically doing it early in the day, it's going to be better.

1480
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,880
 I don't necessarily recommend doing it right before sleep, but some people do it in the

1481
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:58,660
 afternoon and some people will indeed do that seven days a week.

1482
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:01,320
 Other people three days a week, other people every once in a while.

1483
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:08,080
 What I can say is once you become cold water adapted, once it no longer has the same impact

1484
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:12,360
 of novelty and feeling a bit like a, I don't want to say a shock to your system because

1485
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:18,600
 you don't want to go into cold water shock, but once it is comfortable for you, then it

1486
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,320
 will no longer evoke this release.

1487
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:24,320
 There really does seem to be something in the pathway from cold water exposure through the

1488
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:29,560
 norepinephrine pathway and into the mesolamic brainstem that causes this release in dopamine.

1489
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:32,480
 But nonetheless, it's a basically zero cost.

1490
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:36,120
 I mean, you need access to water of some sort, cold water, shower, et cetera, but basically

1491
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:41,080
 zero cost way of triggering a long lasting increase in dopamine without ingesting anything,

1492
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,000
 no pharmacology whatsoever.

1493
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,040
 Please again, approach it with safety and caution in mind, but it is a very potent stimulus.

1494
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:54,280
 Again, 250% rise in baseline, two and a half times rise in baseline, rivals that of course

1495
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,880
 cocaine, which is really remarkable.

1496
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:01,120
 Now I'd like to talk about the positive aspects of rewards for our behavior and the negative

1497
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:03,160
 aspects of rewards for our behavior.

1498
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:09,160
 And from that, I will suggest a protocol by which you can achieve a better relationship

1499
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:12,000
 to your activities and to your dopamine system.

1500
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:20,680
 In fact, it will help tune up your dopamine system for discipline, hard work and motivation.

1501
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:22,600
 Hard work is hard.

1502
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:26,200
 Generally, most people don't like working hard.

1503
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:32,920
 Some people do, but most people work hard in order to achieve some end goal.

1504
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:37,960
 End goals are terrific and rewards are terrific, whether or not they are monetary, social or

1505
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:39,680
 any kind.

1506
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:47,240
 However, because of the way that dopamine relates to our perception of time, working

1507
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:54,320
 hard at something for sake of a reward that comes afterward can make the hard work much

1508
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:59,920
 more challenging and make us much less likely to lean into hard work in the future.

1509
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,960
 Let me give you a couple of examples by way of data and experiments.

1510
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:10,960
 There's a classic experiment done actually at Stanford many years ago in which children

1511
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:16,080
 in nursery school and kindergarten drew pictures and they drew pictures because they like to

1512
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,800
 draw.

1513
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:22,960
 The researchers took kids that liked to draw and they started giving them a reward for

1514
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:23,960
 drawing.

1515
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:30,520
 The reward generally was a gold star or something that a young child would find rewarding.

1516
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:36,440
 Then they stopped giving them the gold star and what they found is the children had a

1517
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:41,280
 much lower tendency to draw on their own.

1518
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,280
 No reward.

1519
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:47,680
 Now remember this was an activity that prior to receiving a reward, the children intrinsically

1520
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,880
 enjoyed and selected to do.

1521
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,920
 No one was telling them to draw.

1522
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:57,480
 What this relates to is so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.

1523
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:03,080
 When we receive rewards, even if we give ourselves rewards for something, we tend to associate

1524
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:08,160
 less pleasure with the actual activity itself that evoked the reward.

1525
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:12,120
 That might seem counterintuitive but that's just the way that these dopaminergic circuits

1526
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:13,840
 work.

1527
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,760
 Now understanding these peaks and baselines and dopamine, which I won't review again,

1528
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,440
 this should make sense.

1529
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:26,720
 If you get a peak in dopamine from a reward, it's going to lower your baseline and the

1530
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:32,120
 cognitive interpretation is that you didn't really do the activity because you enjoyed

1531
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,640
 the activity, you did it for the reward.

1532
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:39,760
 This doesn't mean all rewards of all kinds are bad but it's also important to understand

1533
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,160
 that dopamine controls our perception of time.

1534
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:49,200
 When and how much dopamine we experience is the way that we carve up what we call our

1535
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,720
 experience of time.

1536
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:57,360
 When we engage in an activity, let's say school or hard work of any kind or exercise, because

1537
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:02,640
 of the reward we are going to give ourselves or receive at the end, the trophy, the Sunday,

1538
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:07,000
 the meal, whatever it happens to be.

1539
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:14,280
 We actually are extending the time bin over which we are analyzing or perceiving that

1540
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:22,200
 experience and because the reward comes at the end, we start to dissociate the neural

1541
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:28,840
 circuits for dopamine and reward that would have normally been active during the activity

1542
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:35,120
 and because it all arrives at the end, over time, we have the experience of less and less

1543
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:39,560
 pleasure from that particular activity while we are doing it.

1544
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:43,200
 This is the antithesis of growth mindset.

1545
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:48,320
 My colleague at Stanford, Carol Dweck, as many of you know, has come up with this incredible

1546
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,360
 theory and principle and it actually goes beyond theory and principle called growth

1547
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:56,720
 mindset which is this striving to be better, to be in this mindset of I'm not there yet

1548
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:03,160
 but striving itself is the end goal and that of course delivers you to tremendous performance

1549
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:06,760
 has been observed over and over and over again that people that have growth mindset, kids

1550
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:10,880
 that have growth mindset end up performing very well because they're focused on the effort

1551
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:15,640
 itself and all of us can cultivate growth mindset.

1552
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:21,600
 The neural mechanism of cultivating growth mindset involves learning to access the rewards

1553
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,960
 from effort and doing.

1554
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:29,960
 And that's hard to do because you have to engage this prefrontal component of the mesolambic

1555
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:30,960
 circuit.

1556
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,800
 You have to tell yourself, okay, this effort is great.

1557
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,440
 This effort is pleasurable even though you might actually be in a state of physical pain

1558
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:41,640
 from the exercise or I can recall this from college just feeling like I wanted to get

1559
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:45,240
 up from my desk but forcing myself to study, forcing myself and forcing myself.

1560
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:49,420
 What you find over time is that you can start to associate a dopamine release.

1561
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:55,960
 You can evoke dopamine release from the friction and the challenge that you happen to be in.

1562
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:02,440
 You completely eliminate the ability to generate those circuits and the rewarding process of

1563
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:06,240
 being able to reward friction while in effort.

1564
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:11,080
 If you are focused only on the goal that comes at the end because of the way that dopamine

1565
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:12,640
 marks time.

1566
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:16,360
 So if you say, oh, I'm going to do this very hard thing and I'm going to push and push and

1567
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:23,740
 push and push for that end goal that comes later, not only do you enjoy the process of

1568
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:28,620
 what you're doing less, you actually make it more painful while you're engaging in it.

1569
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:32,740
 You make yourself less efficient at it because if you were able to access dopamine while

1570
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:36,860
 in effort, dopamine has all these incredible properties of increasing the amount of energy

1571
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:41,820
 in our body and in our mind, our ability to focus by way of dopamine's conversion into

1572
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:43,340
 epinephrine.

1573
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:48,560
 But also you are undermining your ability to lean back into that activity the next time.

1574
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:54,080
 The next time you need twice as much coffee and three times as much loud music and four

1575
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:58,640
 times as much energy drink and the social connection just to get out the door in order

1576
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,880
 to do the run or to study.

1577
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:07,540
 So what's more beneficial in fact can serve as a tremendous amplifier on all endeavors

1578
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:14,980
 that you engage in, especially hard endeavors is to a not start layering in other sources

1579
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:19,860
 of dopamine in order to get to the starting line, not layering in other sources of dopamine

1580
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:25,240
 in order to be able to continue, but rather to subjectively start to attach the feeling

1581
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:30,460
 of friction and effort to an internally generated reward system.

1582
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:32,460
 And this is not meant to be vague.

1583
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:37,540
 This is a system that exists in your mind that exists in the minds of humans for hundreds

1584
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:42,660
 of thousands of years by which you're not just pursuing the things that are innately

1585
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:48,060
 pleasurable food, sex, warmth, water when you're thirsty.

1586
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:53,180
 But the beauty of this miso limbic reward pathway that I talked about earlier is that

1587
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:54,420
 it includes the forebrain.

1588
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:59,220
 So you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part.

1589
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:00,220
 I know it's painful.

1590
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:02,420
 I know this doesn't feel good, but I'm focused on this.

1591
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:05,060
 I'm going to start to access the reward.

1592
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:10,140
 You will find the rewards, meaning the dopamine release inside of effort.

1593
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:14,300
 If you repeat this over and over again, and what's beautiful about it is that it starts

1594
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:17,580
 to become reflexive for all types of effort.

1595
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:23,180
 When we focus only on the trophy, only on the grade, only on the win as the reward, you

1596
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:25,660
 undermine that entire process.

1597
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:27,500
 So how do you do this?

1598
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:31,580
 You do this in those moments of the most intense friction.

1599
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:34,940
 You tell yourself, this is very painful.

1600
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:40,940
 And because it's painful, it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later, meaning

1601
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:44,300
 it will increase my baseline in dopamine.

1602
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:50,620
 But you also have to tell yourself that in that moment, you are doing it by choice and

1603
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:53,780
 you're doing it because you love it.

1604
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:58,540
 And I know that sounds like lying to yourself and in some ways it is lying to yourself, but

1605
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:05,180
 it's lying to yourself in the context of a truth which is that you want it to feel better.

1606
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:07,860
 You want it to feel even pleasurable.

1607
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:14,060
 Now this is very far and away different from thinking about the reward that comes at the

1608
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:18,020
 end, the hot fudge Sunday after you cross the finish line and you can replace hot fudge

1609
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:22,140
 Sunday with whatever reward happens to be appealing to you.

1610
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:25,900
 You revere people who are capable of doing what I'm describing.

1611
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:28,220
 David Goggins comes to mind as a really good example.

1612
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:32,780
 Many of you are probably familiar with David Goggins, former Navy SEAL who essentially has

1613
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:40,940
 made a post-military career out of explaining and sharing his process of turning the effort

1614
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:42,780
 into the reward.

1615
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:47,140
 There are many other examples of this too, of course.

1616
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:51,500
 Throughout evolutionary history, there's no question that we revered people who were willing

1617
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:58,060
 to go out and forage and hunt and gather and caretake in ways that other members of our

1618
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:02,500
 species probably found exhausting and probably would have preferred to just put their feet

1619
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:06,160
 up or soak them in a cool stream rather than continue to forage.

1620
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:13,980
 The ability to access this pleasure from effort aspect of our dopaminergic circuitry is without

1621
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:19,660
 question the most powerful aspect of dopamine and our biology of dopamine.

1622
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:23,140
 And the beautiful thing is it's accessible to all of us.

1623
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:28,220
 But just to highlight the things that can interfere with and prevent you from getting

1624
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:36,100
 dopamine release from effort itself, don't spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort

1625
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:39,800
 and don't spike dopamine after engaging in effort.

1626
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:43,220
 Learn to spike your dopamine from effort itself.

1627
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:50,060
 One straightforward example of learning to attach dopamine to effort and strain as opposed

1628
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:56,340
 to a process or a reward that naturally evokes dopamine release is so-called intermittent

1629
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:57,340
 fasting.

1630
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:59,740
 I know this is very popular nowadays.

1631
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:01,300
 Some people like to do intermittent fasting.

1632
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:02,500
 Some people don't.

1633
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,300
 Some people have a 12-hour feeding window every 24 hours.

1634
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:08,260
 Some people do long fasts of two to three days even.

1635
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:12,660
 I personally don't monitor a feeding window with a lot of precision.

1636
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:16,500
 I tend to skip one meal a day, either breakfast or lunch, and then I eat the other two meals

1637
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,220
 of the day depending on which meal I skip.

1638
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:22,780
 So it's either breakfast, lunch, and maybe a little something in the evening, or I'll

1639
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:25,900
 skip breakfast and do lunch and dinner and so on.

1640
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:31,380
 Many people are now eating this way in part because many people find it easier to not

1641
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:36,220
 eat at all than to eat a smaller portion of some food.

1642
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:42,140
 And that has everything to do with the dopamine reward evoking properties of food.

1643
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:47,260
 When we ingest food or when we are about to ingest food, our dopamine levels go up.

1644
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:51,980
 And typically when we ingest food, if it evokes some dopamine release, then we tend to want

1645
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:52,980
 even more food.

1646
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:56,940
 Remember, dopamine's main role is one of motivation and seeking.

1647
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:03,660
 And what dopamine always wants more of is more dopamine, more activity or thing that

1648
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:05,380
 evokes more dopamine release.

1649
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:11,460
 Well, let's just look at fasting from the perspective of dopamine schedules and dopamine

1650
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:15,180
 release and peaks and baselines.

1651
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:21,300
 Typically when we eat, we get dopamine release, especially when we eat after being very hungry.

1652
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:26,180
 If you've ever gone camping or you're very, very hungry, the food tastes that much better.

1653
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:33,580
 And that's actually because of the way that deprivation states increase the way that dopaminergic

1654
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:35,240
 circuits work.

1655
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:41,340
 Your perception of dopamine is heightened when the receptors for dopamine have not seen

1656
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:42,500
 much dopamine lately.

1657
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:43,940
 They haven't bound much dopamine.

1658
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:49,300
 So when you fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, and then you finally eat, it evokes more dopamine

1659
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:50,300
 release.

1660
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:56,300
 So this is the big reward that comes at the end, even bigger because you deprived yourself.

1661
01:49:56,300 --> 01:50:01,460
 This is true for all rewarding behaviors and activities, by the way, the longer you restrict

1662
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:06,440
 yourself from that activity, the greater the dopamine experience when the dopamine is finally

1663
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:10,940
 released because of an upregulation of the receptors for dopamine.

1664
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:15,920
 But I just spent five minutes or more telling you that you should avoid too much reward

1665
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:22,680
 at the end and you should actually focus on the dopamine that you can consciously evoke

1666
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:25,200
 from the deprivation strain and effort.

1667
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:30,400
 And in fact, this is what happens for many people that start doing fasting and take a

1668
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,400
 liking to it.

1669
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:36,380
 Many people say that their state of mind when they fast is clearer, that they actually

1670
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:39,180
 start to enjoy the period of fasting.

1671
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:43,620
 In fact, some people start pushing out their eating window or skipping entire days of eating

1672
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:49,860
 more and more in order to get deeper into that state of mind where surely it's not just

1673
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:52,020
 dopamine, but dopamine is released.

1674
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,300
 They will track their clock.

1675
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:56,080
 Oh, I've been fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera.

1676
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:01,760
 They are starting to attach dopamine release or create dopamine release from the deprivation,

1677
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:04,000
 not from the food reward itself.

1678
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,920
 And this, I think, makes it an interesting practice and one that certainly has been practiced

1679
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:13,460
 by for centuries in different cultures and different religions of deliberately restricting

1680
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:19,880
 food, not just to increase the rewarding properties of food itself, but also to increase the rewarding

1681
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:22,160
 properties of deprivation.

1682
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:26,780
 And I should emphasize that a lot of the subjective aspects of the knowledge of the benefits of

1683
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:34,980
 fasting serve as reinforcing dopamine amplifying aspects to fasting, meaning if somebody does

1684
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:39,280
 intermittent fasting and they are deep into their fast and they're telling themselves,

1685
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:44,520
 oh, my blood lipid profiles are probably improving and my glucose management is probably improving.

1686
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:47,280
 My insulin sensitivity is going up and I'm going to live longer.

1687
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:53,140
 All these things that have some basis from animal studies and some basis or not from

1688
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:56,840
 human studies, it's all kind of still an emerging literature, but it does seem to be pointing

1689
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:02,480
 in that direction that fasting can encourage things like autophagy, the engulfment of dead

1690
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,680
 cells and things of that sort.

1691
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:10,880
 Well, as people tell themselves these things, they are enhancing the rewarding properties

1692
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,100
 of the behavior of fasting.

1693
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:18,840
 And so this is a salient example of where knowledge of knowledge can actually help us

1694
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,240
 change these deep primitive circuits related to dopamine.

1695
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:28,200
 And this illustrates how the forebrain, which carries knowledge and carries interpretation

1696
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:34,600
 and rational thought can be used to shape the very circuits that are involved in generating

1697
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:39,160
 reward for what would otherwise just be kind of primitive behaviors, hardwired behaviors.

1698
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:41,520
 And that's the beauty of these dopamine circuits.

1699
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,680
 That's the beauty of dopamine.

1700
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:49,660
 It's not just attached to the more primitive behaviors of food, sex, heat, et cetera.

1701
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:54,820
 It's also attached to the things that we decide are good for us and are important for us.

1702
01:52:54,820 --> 01:53:00,740
 So telling yourself that exercise or fasting or studying or listening better or any kind

1703
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:06,020
 of behavior is good for you will actually reinforce the extent to which it is good for

1704
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:08,140
 you at a chemical level.

1705
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:13,520
 And a somewhat eerie example of what I just mentioned was a study that was published last

1706
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:19,600
 year in the journal Neuron, self-press journal, excellent journal that showed that hearing

1707
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:25,580
 something that reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine release.

1708
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:31,560
 So the dopamine pathway is so vulnerable to subjective interpretation that it actually

1709
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:35,820
 makes it such that when we see something or hear something that validates a belief that

1710
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:40,780
 we already have, that itself can increase dopamine release.

1711
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:45,860
 Along the lines of how dopamine and dopamine schedules and our perception of things can

1712
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:51,220
 shape the way that we experience things as pleasurable or not, there are beautiful studies,

1713
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:56,580
 mainly looking at sugar appetite and our sense of pleasure from sweet things, but also for

1714
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:58,740
 savory foods, et cetera.

1715
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:01,580
 And essentially the results that come out of this are the following.

1716
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:06,620
 If you ingest something that you like, it tastes good to you, but then you ingest something

1717
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:12,180
 that's even sweeter or even more savory and then you go back to the food that you ate

1718
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:15,700
 previously, well, you don't like it as much.

1719
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:22,540
 And that might seem like a duh, obviously, but that shift in perception can be blocked

1720
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:25,300
 by blocking the shift in dopamine.

1721
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:29,420
 And so this really speaks to these peaks and valleys in dopamine that I mentioned before

1722
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:35,140
 and how your experience of anything is going to depend on your prior experience of other

1723
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:36,980
 things that evoke dopamine.

1724
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:43,100
 Big dopamine release makes it more challenging to experience more big dopamine release.

1725
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:47,940
 So dopamine is one of those things that you don't want too high or too low for too long.

1726
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:52,580
 It's all about staying in that dynamic range and that's going to be different for everybody.

1727
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:59,740
 So for the very savory foods that are now everywhere, those highly savory foods or I

1728
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:06,100
 think they call them highly palatable foods are making more bland foods, whole foods,

1729
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:07,500
 meaning foods that aren't processed.

1730
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:10,220
 It's making those taste less good at least for a while.

1731
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:16,020
 And all it takes is a short period of time, even just days, two days or so, of not consuming

1732
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:18,220
 any highly palatable foods.

1733
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:24,660
 And suddenly, broccoli with just a little bit of seasoning tastes delicious to you.

1734
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:29,220
 So again, this just speaks to the fact that dopamine is this universal currency.

1735
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:33,420
 It establishes value based on not just what you're experiencing in the moment, but what

1736
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:36,740
 you experienced in the days and minutes before.

1737
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:41,500
 Now that you understand how your previous level of dopamine relates to your current

1738
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:46,860
 level of dopamine and how your current level of dopamine will influence your future level

1739
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:53,920
 of dopamine, it should become obvious why things like pornography, not just the accessibility

1740
01:55:53,920 --> 01:56:01,340
 of pornography, but the intensity of pornography can negatively shape real world romantic and

1741
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:02,780
 sexual interactions.

1742
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:04,100
 This is a serious concern.

1743
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:06,340
 The discussion is happening now.

1744
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:10,100
 The underlying neurobiological mechanisms you now understand.

1745
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:14,900
 And this isn't to pass judgment on whether or not people like or don't like pornography.

1746
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:15,900
 It's an ethical discussion.

1747
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:22,740
 It's a moral discussion that has to be decided for each individual by virtue of age, etc.

1748
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:29,940
 But again, any activity that evokes a lot of dopamine release will make it harder to

1749
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:36,980
 achieve the same level and certainly the greater level of dopamine through a subsequent interaction.

1750
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:43,060
 So yes, indeed, many people are addicted to pornography and yes, indeed, many people who

1751
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:49,220
 regularly indulge in pornography experience challenges in real world romantic interactions.

1752
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:52,340
 You now understand the mechanisms behind what I'm telling you.

1753
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:57,820
 Now there are circumstances in which increasing levels of dopamine is desirable and advantageous

1754
01:56:57,820 --> 01:56:59,460
 and clinically helpful.

1755
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:04,020
 Good example of this would be the drug well butrin, also called Bupriarone, which increases

1756
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:05,580
 dopamine and norepinephrine.

1757
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:10,520
 Well butrin Bupriarone was developed as an alternative treatment for depression because

1758
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:16,060
 some people who take the so-called SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which as the

1759
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:21,660
 name suggests, increase serotonin suffer from serotonin related side effects.

1760
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:27,380
 Things like decreased appetite, decreased libido or sometimes increased appetite or

1761
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:30,540
 other side effects that they don't want.

1762
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:34,300
 And well butrin seems to avoid the sexual side effects.

1763
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:40,560
 It can blunt appetite and these sorts of things because of the increase in norepinephrine

1764
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:47,200
 and dopamine increases levels of motivation and craving but also can create a state of

1765
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:52,480
 elevated alertness that can sometimes get in the way of healthy eating and things of

1766
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:53,480
 that sort.

1767
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:56,680
 So one has to work with their clinician as a psychiatrist.

1768
01:57:56,680 --> 01:58:01,280
 It is a prescription drug in order to find the dosage of well butrin that's correct for

1769
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,280
 them.

1770
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:06,620
 In addition, things like well butrin Bupriarone can increase anxiety because of the way that

1771
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:10,860
 dopamine and norepinephrine are stimulating and tend to place people into heightened levels

1772
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:11,860
 of alertness.

1773
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:17,260
 Nonetheless, many people have gained terrific relief from depression from well butrin Bupriarone

1774
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:21,180
 and many of those same people had serious trouble with some of the SSRIs.

1775
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:25,620
 So those seem to be a very useful drug in certain contexts, both for depression and for

1776
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:29,260
 the treatment of smoking for people desiring to quit smoking.

1777
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:33,160
 And of course there are a lot of people out there who are seeking to increase their baseline

1778
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:38,980
 levels of dopamine without taking any prescription pharmaceutical compounds.

1779
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:42,520
 And nowadays there exist a lot of supplements to do that.

1780
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:48,480
 The two most common ones that are directly within the dopamine pathway are mucuna prurines

1781
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:54,560
 which is actually a velvety bean whose contents are L-dopa.

1782
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:58,760
 Believe it or not, the content of this bean is the precursor to dopamine.

1783
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:04,700
 So mucuna prurines is sold over the counter, at least in the United States, and it literally

1784
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:07,340
 is the precursor to dopamine.

1785
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:11,340
 Meaning if you take it, you will experience very large increases in dopamine.

1786
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:14,340
 Those increases are transient and very, very intense.

1787
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:20,100
 And in fact, if you look at the constellation of effects of mucuna prurines, what you find

1788
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:25,740
 is that they're pretty striking and they look a lot like, if not identical to, L-dopa.

1789
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:29,800
 The most obvious of those is in the context of Parkinson's disease.

1790
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:34,720
 There are at least five studies that have shown that mucuna prurines can reduce the

1791
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:39,640
 symptoms of Parkinson's disease much in the same way that L-dopa can reduce the symptoms

1792
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,560
 of Parkinson's disease.

1793
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:45,080
 And that shouldn't come as any surprise given what I just told you that mucuna prurines is

1794
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:46,920
 essentially L-dopa.

1795
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:50,600
 It also can reduce a particular hormone called prolactin.

1796
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:55,240
 Dopamine and prolactin tend to be in somewhat push-pull fashion when dopamine is up, prolactin

1797
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:57,740
 is down, and vice versa.

1798
01:59:57,740 --> 01:59:59,700
 Prolactin is involved in milk let down in women.

1799
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:06,060
 It's involved in setting the refractory period for sex after ejaculation in males.

1800
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:10,380
 The reason mating can occur and then not occur after ejaculation is because of an increase

1801
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:11,380
 in prolactin.

1802
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:15,060
 Mucuna prurines is often used to blunt prolactin.

1803
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:20,020
 And there are actually a couple of studies showing that it can indeed do that.

1804
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:23,900
 Mucuna prurines has a number of other effects that lie in the sort of sex and reproduction

1805
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:27,400
 pathway that are worth noting.

1806
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:32,600
 Sperm concentration, sperm quality is actually greatly increased by mucuna prurines.

1807
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:35,800
 These are kind of curious effects until you understand a little bit more about the biology

1808
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:38,080
 of dopamine, which I'll mention in a moment.

1809
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:46,200
 But there are several studies for, in fact, that describe how mucuna prurines can increase

1810
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:49,760
 sperm count, sperm quality, and sperm motility.

1811
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:54,860
 So for those of you seeking to conceive children, mucuna prurines might be an interesting choice

1812
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:58,260
 if you're interested in exploring non-prescription compounds.

1813
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:06,020
 However, I should mention that any time you consume a substance that increases dopamine

1814
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:12,220
 by mimicking dopamine or acting as a direct precursor to dopamine, there's almost inevitably

1815
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:18,780
 a crash or a reduction in the baseline in dopamine that we referred to previously.

1816
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:24,080
 So many people who take mucuna prurines feel really elevated, really motivated, really

1817
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:29,240
 alert, all the sorts of things that one would expect from a dopaminergic drug, which mucuna

1818
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:36,700
 prurines is, and then they feel a low or a reduction in drive and excitement and enthusiasm

1819
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:42,080
 after the drug wears off, just like they would with any other dopamine-increasing compound.

1820
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:46,880
 For that reason, many people have turned to the use of ltyrosine.

1821
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:53,300
 Ltyrosine is an amino acid precursor to L-dopa, so it lies further up the dopamine synthesis

1822
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,300
 pathway.

1823
02:01:54,300 --> 02:02:00,020
 And nowadays, it's very common because ltyrosine is sold over the counter in the United States

1824
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:06,300
 that people will take ltyrosine as a way to get more energized, alert, and focused.

1825
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:11,060
 Indeed, there are data that ltyrosine will accomplish that.

1826
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:16,840
 Ltyrosine is typically taken in capsule form or powder form, anywhere from 500 to 750 to

1827
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:18,620
 1,000 milligrams.

1828
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:23,640
 It is a potent stimulus for increasing dopamine, and the time scale for increasing dopamine

1829
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:26,880
 is about 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion.

1830
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:28,400
 Dopamine levels start to peak.

1831
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:34,160
 The classic study that really nailed down the fact that ltyrosine has this effect was

1832
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:40,120
 published way back in 1983, journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism, that directly

1833
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:48,620
 compared ltyrosine supplementation with tryptophan ingestion on plasma dopamine and serotonin,

1834
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:51,460
 tryptophan being a precursor to serotonin.

1835
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:57,100
 And indeed, what they found is that ingestion of ltyrosine can increase the amount of dopamine

1836
02:02:57,100 --> 02:03:02,020
 circulating in the blood and in the brain too, of course.

1837
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:07,900
 The tyrosine ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes, and they were short-lasting.

1838
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:12,920
 After about 30 minutes, the effect had dissipated, meaning the levels of dopamine had dropped

1839
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:14,200
 down to baseline.

1840
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:19,200
 And even though they didn't look at levels of baseline dopamine past that time point,

1841
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:23,720
 the expectation based on everything we know about dopamine biology is that it would then

1842
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:29,840
 drop below baseline due to the depletion of the readily-reservable pool of dopamine vesicles

1843
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,800
 that we talked about way back at the beginning of this episode.

1844
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:37,440
 The nice thing about this study is it does show specificity of effect because ingestion

1845
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:40,460
 of tryptophan did not increase dopamine.

1846
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:42,380
 Instead, it increased serotonin.

1847
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:48,180
 So there's really specificity of these pathways that rule out any placebo-type effects.

1848
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:53,620
 I'm not suggesting that anybody, everybody, increase their dopamine levels by way of tyrosine

1849
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:55,980
 and mucuna purines.

1850
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:59,980
 For those of you that are seeking to increase your dopamine levels without prescription drugs,

1851
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:01,940
 those are the most direct route to that.

1852
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:07,420
 Of course, if you have a preexisting dopaminergic condition, so schizophrenia or psychosis,

1853
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:15,280
 of any kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like mucuna purines and tyrosine will not be good

1854
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,280
 for you.

1855
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:22,320
 And if you don't, you should just understand and expect that it's going to lead to an increase

1856
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:23,520
 in dopamine.

1857
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:25,200
 You'll certainly feel an elevated state.

1858
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:27,920
 For some of you that might be agitating.

1859
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:29,720
 For some of you that might be really pleasurable.

1860
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:32,020
 And then you will feel a crash afterwards.

1861
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:33,680
 How deep is that crash?

1862
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:38,500
 People really depend on your biology and where your dopamine baseline began.

1863
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:43,740
 So I personally am not a fan of using things like mucuna purines at all for myself for

1864
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:45,920
 the reasons I mentioned earlier.

1865
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,300
 Just too intense and too much of a crash.

1866
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:53,820
 I do use tyrosine from time to time for enhancing focus and motivation, but I want to emphasize

1867
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:55,320
 it from time to time.

1868
02:04:55,320 --> 02:05:00,100
 So I might use it once a week, occasionally twice a week, but I've never been one to take

1869
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:04,880
 L-tyrosine regularly in order to focus or train or do any kind of mental work.

1870
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:11,120
 I just don't want to rely on any exogenous substance in order to get my dopamine circuits

1871
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:12,720
 activated.

1872
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:16,960
 And I don't want to experience the drop in dopamine that inevitably occurs some period

1873
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,440
 of time afterwards.

1874
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:24,240
 I should also mention things that can reduce your levels of baseline dopamine.

1875
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:27,600
 One that is rarely discussed is melatonin.

1876
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:33,220
 I have talked before on this podcast about melatonin, why I am not a fan of using melatonin

1877
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,180
 in order to enhance sleep.

1878
02:05:35,180 --> 02:05:37,540
 It can help one get to sleep, but not stay asleep.

1879
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:41,340
 Dr. Matt Walker, sleep expert from University of California, Berkeley.

1880
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:47,980
 I think I don't want to put words in his mouth, but in our discussion about melatonin on this

1881
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:53,180
 podcast when Matt was a guest and in his book and on other podcasts, Matt has generally

1882
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:57,840
 stated that the use of melatonin except for treatment of jet lag is generally not a good

1883
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:59,760
 idea and I agree.

1884
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:04,960
 I think that melatonin is not often thought about as impacting the dopamine pathway, but

1885
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:08,840
 there's at least one study published in 2001.

1886
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:12,640
 First author is Nishiyama, just as it sounds.

1887
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:14,760
 It's spelled just as it sounds.

1888
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:18,440
 Acute effects of melatonin administration on cardiovascular autonomic regulation in

1889
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:19,440
 healthy men.

1890
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:23,720
 The study wasn't specifically about dopamine, but they looked at norepinephrine and dopamine

1891
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:31,120
 levels and they found a statistically significant decrease in dopamine 60 minutes after melatonin

1892
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:32,120
 administration.

1893
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:38,280
 I've talked before about how viewing bright lights between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

1894
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:44,400
 has been shown in studies by Dr. Samar Hattar, David Berson, excellent circadian scientist

1895
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:48,380
 to reduce levels of dopamine for several days after that light exposure.

1896
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:50,560
 So dim the lights at night.

1897
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:56,440
 If you can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning if you don't have to take melatonin and you

1898
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:00,000
 can find a better alternative, that would be a good idea if you want to maintain healthy

1899
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,800
 levels of dopamine.

1900
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:05,640
 Now there is one compound that you are all familiar with and you've probably actually

1901
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:11,680
 taken without realizing it that increases dopamine and that's something called PEA for

1902
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,360
 phenyl ethyl amine, technically beta phenyl ethyl amine.

1903
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:19,580
 And PEA is found in various foods.

1904
02:07:19,580 --> 02:07:24,940
 Chocolate just happens to be one enriched in PEA and can increase synaptic levels of

1905
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:26,740
 dopamine.

1906
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:34,340
 I personally take PEA from time to time as a focus and work aid in order to do intense

1907
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:35,340
 bouts of work.

1908
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:36,940
 Again, I don't do that too often.

1909
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:39,220
 This might be once a week or once every two weeks.

1910
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:41,740
 I might use it for training, but typically I don't.

1911
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:43,420
 It's usually for mental work.

1912
02:07:43,420 --> 02:07:49,420
 And I will take 500 milligrams of PEA and I'll take 300 milligrams of alpha GPC.

1913
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:50,980
 That's something that I personally do.

1914
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:51,980
 That's what's right for me.

1915
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:54,120
 It's within my margins of safety for my health.

1916
02:07:54,120 --> 02:07:58,040
 Again, you have to check with your doctor and decide what's right for you.

1917
02:07:58,040 --> 02:08:05,720
 It leads to a sharp but very transient increase in dopamine that lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.

1918
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:12,320
 And at least in my system, I found to be much more regulated and kind of even than something

1919
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:17,900
 like L-tyrosine and certainly much more regulated and even and lower dopamine release than something

1920
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:20,380
 like Macuna Purines.

1921
02:08:20,380 --> 02:08:25,060
 One of the lesser talked about compounds that's out there, but that's gaining popularity

1922
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:30,660
 for increasing dopamine and as a so-called new tropic is something called Hooperzine-A.

1923
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:36,520
 Hooperzine-A is a compound sold over the counter, at least in the United States, that can increase

1924
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:40,500
 acetylcholine transmission, a different neuromodulator entirely.

1925
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:45,840
 What's interesting is that Hooperzine-A somehow by way of interactions between the cholinergic

1926
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:52,000
 system and the dopaminergic system leads to increases in dopamine in the medial prefrontal

1927
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,720
 cortex and hippocampus.

1928
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:57,240
 Hippocampus, of course, being an area of the brain associated with learning and memory

1929
02:08:57,240 --> 02:09:01,440
 and prefrontal cortex being associated with the mesolimbic pathway, decision-making, focus,

1930
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,560
 et cetera.

1931
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:07,040
 And so I think the reason why we're seeing an increase in popularity of companies including

1932
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:12,220
 Hooperzine-A and new tropic compounds is both for the cholinergic stimulating properties,

1933
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:15,500
 but also for stimulating dopamine release.

1934
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:17,580
 I personally have never tried Hooperzine-A.

1935
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:22,580
 You can go to examine.com or put Hooperzine-A into PubMed if you'd like to search around

1936
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:24,300
 and see some of the science behind it.

1937
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:26,300
 Again, I'm not recommending anyone take these things.

1938
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:30,220
 In fact, I recommend against anyone just diving in and starting to consume things without

1939
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:34,020
 gaining knowledge about how they function and whether or not they're right for you.

1940
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:38,760
 But nonetheless, I think in the years to come, we are going to see a lot more of L-tyrosine,

1941
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:44,760
 PEA, phenylethylamine, and Hooperzine as a way of tapping into the dopaminergic and

1942
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:50,160
 cholinergic circuits, certainly along with things like AlphaGPC, as non-prescription,

1943
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:56,480
 short-lived, somewhat milder alternatives to things that really spike dopamine, things

1944
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:00,680
 like Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, and similar.

1945
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:02,960
 And I can't help but share with you one more result.

1946
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:05,140
 It's not related to pharmacology.

1947
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:08,660
 It's related to behaviors and social interactions.

1948
02:10:08,660 --> 02:10:13,220
 And that's the very interesting and I would say important finding that was made a few years

1949
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:17,620
 ago by my colleague Rob Malenka, who's in our department of psychiatry at Stanford,

1950
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:23,660
 showing that oxytocin and social connection is actually directly stimulating the dopamine

1951
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:24,660
 pathway.

1952
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:32,020
 I think for many years, all of us, including me, would hear and thought that oxytocin was

1953
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:36,560
 in the serotonergic pathway, that it was about pair bonding and it was about some of these

1954
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:41,560
 neuromodulators that were more associated with things related to feeling good with what

1955
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:43,680
 we have in the present moment.

1956
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:47,000
 That's typically what we think of when we think of the opioid system or the serotonergic

1957
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,160
 system.

1958
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:51,120
 The dopamine system is really about seeking and reward.

1959
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:57,040
 But in a paper published in 2017 in the journal Science, excellent journal, the paper is titled

1960
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:02,700
 Gating of Social Reward by Oxytocin, excuse me, in the ventral tegmental area.

1961
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:04,260
 You now know what the ventral tegmental area.

1962
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:06,420
 It's that area of the mesolymbic pathway.

1963
02:11:06,420 --> 02:11:12,140
 What this paper essentially showed is that oxytocin, social connection and pair bonding

1964
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:15,300
 itself triggers dopamine release.

1965
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:21,860
 And as everyone read this result, we all realized, ah, this makes total sense that for the evolution

1966
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:27,020
 of our species, indeed for any species where social connections are important, it's also

1967
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:29,400
 important to go seek social connections.

1968
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:33,960
 And so while it's fun to think about pharmacology and underlying neural circuitry and cold

1969
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:39,640
 water baths and all these different things related to dopamine schedules and reward mechanisms

1970
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:43,280
 and attaching reward to effort and all the various things that we've talked about today

1971
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:48,780
 in terms of science and tools and protocols, I'd be remiss if I didn't include description

1972
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:55,760
 of this result and just emphasize that social connections, close social connections in particular

1973
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:57,420
 that evoke oxytocin release.

1974
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:02,900
 So those are romantic type, those are parent child type, those are friendship related, and

1975
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:06,620
 those can even be just friends at a distance related, right?

1976
02:12:06,620 --> 02:12:12,380
 Doesn't actually require skin contact to get oxytocin release, but oxytocin release

1977
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:16,020
 is central to stimulating the dopamine pathways.

1978
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:19,980
 So the take home message there is quite simple.

1979
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:24,060
 Engage in pursue quality, healthy social interactions.

1980
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:26,280
 I know I've covered a lot of material today.

1981
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:31,120
 I've really tried hard to focus on things that lie directly within the dopamine pathway

1982
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:37,080
 and circuitries, as well as things that directly stimulate those pathways and circuitries.

1983
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:42,880
 What I haven't talked about are all the things that indirectly serve the dopamine pathways

1984
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:47,120
 and out there on the internet and indeed in the scientific literature, you will find for

1985
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:52,520
 instance that things like macarote can increase dopamine, things like the gut microbiome can

1986
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:53,520
 influence dopamine.

1987
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:59,000
 And indeed they can, but they do that through indirect mechanisms by creating an environment,

1988
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,740
 a milieu in which dopamine and dopamine circuits can flourish.

1989
02:13:03,740 --> 02:13:04,840
 Maca is a good example of that.

1990
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:11,000
 It will reduce cortisol and through some indirect pathways related to cortisol can increase dopamine,

1991
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,160
 but it's not a direct increase in dopamine.

1992
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:17,340
 And so as a consequence, it's rather subtle compared to the various compounds and behaviors

1993
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:19,120
 that I talked about today.

1994
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:25,840
 And cold water exposure leads to huge increases in dopamine as we talked about before and

1995
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:28,480
 very sustained ones at that.

1996
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:33,360
 I realize in giving you a lot of information about science and mechanism all the way from

1997
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:38,360
 psychological and biological to circuitry and synaptic transmission, volumetric transmission

1998
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:40,800
 and so forth that it might seem overwhelming.

1999
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,680
 The most important things to understand are that these dopamine pathways really are under

2000
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:46,120
 your control.

2001
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:51,640
 And the locus of control resides in the fact that your previous levels of dopamine are

2002
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:55,700
 influencing your levels of dopamine right now and your current levels of dopamine and

2003
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:59,600
 where you take them next will influence your dopamine levels in the next days and weeks

2004
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:00,600
 to come.

2005
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:05,080
 So I hope both with the mechanisms that you now have in hand, plus some of the tools to

2006
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:09,920
 tap into the dopaminergic system, both behavioral, pharmacologic, prescription and non-prescription,

2007
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:13,720
 et cetera, that you'll feel that you have more control over your dopamine system.

2008
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:18,360
 And certainly that you have a better understanding of your dopamine system so that you can modulate

2009
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:22,200
 and adjust your levels of dopamine in the ways that serve you best.

2025
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:22,880
 Today and on previous podcast episodes, we talked a bit about supplements.

2026
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:26,280
 Supplements certainly aren't necessary, but many people find them beneficial for things

2027
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:30,040
 like adjusting their levels of dopamine or for other purposes.

2028
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:33,200
 If you're going to use supplements, it's very important that the supplements you use

2029
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:38,200
 be of very high quality and that the quantity of ingredients that are on the label match

2030
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:39,640
 what's actually in those bottles.

2031
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:44,320
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorn, Thorne, because Thorn has the highest levels

2032
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:50,040
 of stringency with respect to quality and how much of each supplement they put in the

2033
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,160
 products that they sell.

2034
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:58,160
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take, you can go to thorn.thorne.com/the-letter-u/huberman.

2035
02:15:58,160 --> 02:15:59,320
 And there you can see what I take.

2036
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:02,360
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements.

2037
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:07,240
 And if you navigate into the Thorn site through that portal, then you can get 20% off any

2038
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:09,160
 of the supplements that Thorn makes.
